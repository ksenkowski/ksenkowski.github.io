description: "The Historia Imperio is a document I have translated that is at once a memoir, a history of the Empire, and a conversation between a son and a father he never knew. If I had to put it into a context a reader unschooled in the true history of our world, it is some sort of melding of the styling of the House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski and The Histories, by Herodotus."

If I had to put it into a context a reader unschooled in the true history of our world, it is some sort of melding of the styling of the <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Z. Danielewski and <em>The Histories</em>, by Herodotus.</p>
