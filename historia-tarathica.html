<p class="first">The <em>Historia Tarathica</em> is an encyclopedia compiled by Isidro de Mercer in the 319th year of the Third Era of the Tarathi people up to that point. It forms our most informed picture of the early nomadic lifestyle of these people and the early kingdoms they formed, which would ultimately give shape to much of the West. According to the accompanying letters to the original text I discovered, the work was composed at the urging of his friend Bonifacio de Retarz, the Obispo of Solear. </p>

<p>This a large cumbersome text which he wrote as a series of encyclopedia style entries. It is taking me far longer to translate than I expected as he used the proto-script of the Tatemic peoples rather than the more familiar script of the Vorians. Below you will find links to the various sections broken out into segments. The various entries are also cross referenced by common topics. Isidro used a cypher of various symbols to connect his various entries, which I have tried to match through these common topic headings at the bottom of each article.</p>
