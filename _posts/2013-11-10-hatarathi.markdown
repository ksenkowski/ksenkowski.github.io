The Hatarathi were a Tarathi people from the high plains in the *Unknowable East*. They are first mentioned in the works of Zellas as confederates of the Karatarathi, who at the time of his writing [ The Epistles to Zeno, 1344 2E ], they had taken the Hegoi Wall had overrun Ilaria [ Later Zerem ], Sloria [ Later ], and were threatening Greater Voria. This incursion came to a close when they were routed at the *Battle of Nis* by the Emperodar Claudio Tarathodar and the Dux Primero Amon Restaurado del Mundo. The Hatarathi were driven back over the Hegoi Wall into Kidava [ Later Eastern Toloska ]
