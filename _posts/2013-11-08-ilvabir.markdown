Ilvabir was the Kur of the Ostarathi Kurdom of Greater Voria from 223 to 224 2E. A member of the powerful, but non-royal Tarathi clan of Heldevadi, he took advantage of a relationship with the invading Imperial legato Bermudo to facilitate his election to the throne. Prior to the election he intrigued with Bermudo to eliminate Vitgar, and there was strong suspicion at the time, which was not aleviated by his move of the throne to his clan's seat in XXX.

After moving the throne safely away from the new imperial seat at XXX he installed his nephew Tolivar as commander of the Ostarathi army and soon controlled XXX and XXX. Both of these regions he garrisoned with troops loaned from his uncle, Theodas, the Vestarathi Kur of Tovosa, beginning the process of recovery after the devastation of the previous years. However, his reign was cut short when he was assassinated at a banquet by a visiting Gividas dignitary.
