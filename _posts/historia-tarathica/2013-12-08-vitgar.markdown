Vitigar was the Kur of Ostarathi Greater Voria from 219 through 223 3E, taking to the throne from Thedohar by force during the early stage of the Third Tarathi War as the Imperial legato Bermudo was consolidating his gains in Lesser Voria. Husband of Amal's only surviving child, Untha, he took the child as his bride to strengthen his claim to the kurdom. In this he was successful as the Ostarathi nobility rallied behind him against the invaders for a short time.

Unfortunately for Vitigar's reign, and the fortunes of the Ostarathi Kurdom of Greater Voria, he had his predecessor Thedohar drowned in a barrel of wine. This gave Bermudo the pretext to lay siege to Narro, where Vitigar and his wife had made their court. After a year, they along with the city were captured and sent back to Cidiero, where he died childless. His bride was married to the nephew of Josu I, Josu Taratho de Ilaria.
