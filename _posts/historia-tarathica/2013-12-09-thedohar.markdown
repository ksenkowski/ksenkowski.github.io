Thedohar was the Kur of the Ostarathi from 217 3E to 219 3E, nephew to Thedomir the Great through his sister Lafrida, and cousin to his predicesor, Avalarik. He did not travel with his people into Greater Voria during the invasion, but stayed in Torozium (modern Graziste in Zerem) until he as summoned to assume the regal dignity of the Ostarathi people.

An elderly man at the time of his arrival, he was no fool and realized his peril. He quickly arrested Amal and her confidants who were conspiring to take the throne for themselves, banishing her to an island on Lake Bozeno and executing all other threats by feeding them to rabid dogs.

During the early stages of the war with the Empire, the Ostarathi did not fair well, and with the support of the nobility, the Dur of {Ravenna} Vitgar staged a successful coup. His sons Thedogi and Thedonavi found safety among the Heldevadi after officially giving up any claim to the throne. Thedohar himself was held in luxury until Vitgar had him drowned in a barrel of wine.
