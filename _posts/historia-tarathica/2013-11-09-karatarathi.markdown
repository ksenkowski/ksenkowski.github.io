The Karatarathi were a Tarathi people from the northwestern coast of the Brav Sea. They are first mentioned in the works of Zellas as confederates of the Hatarathi, who at the time of his writing **[ The Epistles to Zeno, 1344 2E ]**, they had taken the Hegoi Wall had overrun Ilaria **[ Later Zerem ]**, Sloria **[ Later Karatan]**, and were threatening Greater Voria. This incursion came to a close when they were routed at the *Battle of Nis* by the Emperodar Claudio Tarathodar. The Karatarathi were driven back over the Hegoi Wall into Zeged Mountains near the fortress of Cerrte **[Later Cerrta]**.

In 50, while the Duque Primero of the East Vincent I de Cibala started the first Tarathi War with their cousins the Hatarathi, the Karatarathi under their Kur Herwig the White, swept across the Orda River north of Cerrte and took Granmonta by surprise. After two years they were able to extract a heavy ransom from the Duque Primero of the West, Veto de Cibala before returning to the Zeged Mountains.

When the Cavasla began to pressue the Totamur tribes in 59, the Karatarathi Kur Anvaric appealed to Veto to allow his people to seek refuge within the Empire from the ravages of the Cavasla. Veto, agreeing with his brother the Duque Primero of the East, refused, preferring to create a sacrificial lamb to feed to the Cavasla Horde. Desperate from fear and a famine that swept the region that year, the Hatarathi and Karatarathi invaded (Second Tarathi War 59-65), with the Karatarathi moving west against Cerrte. There they sacked the great fortress and moved south behind the Hegoi Wall to sack Jardina before threatening Balso.

The end result of this war was a negotiated peace in which the Tarathi remained within the borders of the Empire as a client petty Kurdom. Shortly thereafter the Ostarathi migrated into the Empire and assimilated the Karatarathi. It is unclear how the two related tribes merged, but the end result was that the Karatarathi were subsumed by the Ostarathi.
