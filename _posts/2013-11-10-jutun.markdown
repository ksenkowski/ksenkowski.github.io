The Noderin’s and Sarls believe that the first living beings formed from the primeval chaos were the world giant, Nifmir and the fire serpent Vegap. Out of their struggles, the worlds were born as were the Jotun, the children of Nifmir. They populated the world and enslaved mankind, building cyclopean cities in the frozen north.
