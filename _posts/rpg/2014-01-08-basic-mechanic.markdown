		<p>The basic mechanic has two parts. One is a resource management mechanic tied to the character's three main resources and the other is the actual dice. When a character falls into opposition with the Game Master, meaning the Game Master has decided to say no to the player's narration of events, the GM first determines what kind of Challenge the character must overcome.</p>
		<p>Challenges fall into six categories. These categories dictate how many successes the player must roll as well as what the cost is to the appropriate resource. Vitality is required to engage in any physical activity, Influence for any social activity, and Willpower can be used for any physical, mental or sorcerous activity. The following chart illustrates the costs and requirements per Challenge.</p>

		<p>To resolve a Challenge the player rolls a number of six sided dice equal to the skill appropriate to the Challenge plus an additional die for each appropriate Descriptor piece of Gear. </p>
		<p>Should a character fail, the GM has two options they can pursue. They can either deny the character what they want (boring), give the character what they want and assign them Harm or give the character what they want and add a complication to their plan.</p>
		<p>Harm is essentially a condition that applies a -1D to a specific set of circumstances for a specific set of time. The time is dictated as seen in the Challenge chart above and the circumstances are based on the context of the situation as interpreted by the GM.</p>
		<p>Complications are narrative elements that shift the story in another direction as defined by the Game Master. The typical flow of the game is for the player(s) to narrate what they are doing and for the GM to interact. Complications are the opportunity for the Game Master to move the game in a different direction.</p>
