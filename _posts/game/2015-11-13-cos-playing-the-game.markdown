		<p>He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.</p>

			<p>In <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>, creating playable characters, friends and foes, all follow the same pattern. A <strong>Culture</strong> is combined with a <strong>Vocation</strong> and is then customized with a <strong>Template</strong> and/or a <strong>Historia</strong>. Finally, the character is given two Talents of your choosing and Gear with a value equal to the following formula:</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>Influence Pool x Influence Recovery = Initial Decanidi</em></p>
			<p>The <strong>GM</strong> is the final arbiter as to what <strong>Cultures</strong> and <strong>Archetypes</strong> are available for players to build from, but otherwise any varation is acceptable. The game is about how your <strong>Cell</strong> fights your <strong>Conspiracy</strong>, not about mine.</p>
			<p>Beasts are an entirely different story. They are the things that live outside a cultured society. They are the animals that provide aid, sustinance and companionship. They are also the monsters that hide in the shadows set on consuming that which the civilized have wrought. When bringing them into play, the <strong>GM</strong> simply selects one from the Beastiary and utilizes them as they see fit.</p>

		<p>The <em>Litany of Heroes</em> serves as a living narrative of the trials and tribulations of the Cell and the <em>Conspiracy</em>. This document also serves of a mechanical record of everything that is in play. It marks every important <em>Scene</em>, <em>Turn</em> and <em>Arc</em> in the game. It is an artifact that you create together, with everyone at the table taking turns maintaning the record in their own voice for a full <em>Arc</em>.</p>
		<p>If something is not recored in the <em>Litany of Heroes</em>, it did not happen. Any knowledge gained, places discovered, friends or enemies made, betrayals or triumphs not recorded then the event was just a dream. The <em>Litany of Heroes</em> is the reality of your game and not negotiable.</p>

		<p>The <em>Leader</em> is a character that is at the forefront of each <em>Arc</em>. This can be decided informally as play progresses, or can be selected by the players through consensus. Either way, for that <em>Arc</em> they take on the responsibility of molding the direction of the <em>Cell</em>. Of course this also exposes them to the <em>Conspiracy</em>, making the character the primary target for that <em>Arc</em> and suffering the most.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is designed to be played as an ongoing game, but with an eye towards the busy schedules of working adults. Despite the modular nature of play, life happens and players can miss out on sessions.</p>
		<p>Before play begins, the missing player must take a few minutes to explain what happend to their character. Where did they go? How did they find the rest of the <em>Cell</em>? What trials did they suffer?</p>
		<p>Once the missing player describes the events of their character's absense, the <em>GM</em> is allowed to apply a <em>Condition</em> or add a <em>Twist</em> to the game that falls in line with the events described. They don't have to do this, but it often provides the opportunity to shift the game in a new direction.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is a game about a journey through exotic lands with a wide variety of cultures. The peoples and cultures the <em>Cell</em> will come across will vary in a myriad of ways. It is for this reason the following rules regarding the use of languages is important to maintaining the multicultural atmosphere of the game in play.</p>	
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>Characters that speak the same language suffer no penalties communicating.</li>
			<li>Characters that speak a language from the same language group, but not the same language, suffer a -1R in Challenges and Skirmishes when communication is relevant.</li>
			<li>Characters that have no common language must resort to extreme measures to communicate and suffer a -4R in Challenges and Skirmishes when communication is relevant.</li>
			<li>Characters cannot learn the roots of all languages in the world (Djinni, Alfar, Skalfar and Jutunar) without a specific talent like: <em>Is a natural polygot</em>.</li>

		<p><em>Taint</em> is the potential corruption of a character brought on by following their dark impulses and through encounters with the supernatural. This corruption is both a descent into evil and the progressive loss of a character's humanity. The corruption infuses the character and slowly removes what makes them human.</p>
		<p>Whenever a character takes an action that puts their humanity in jeopardy consult the <em>Taint Modifier Table</em>. Toss the listed number of rune stones and compare the result against the table. If the result provides a rune matching those listed on the table, toss against the <em>Taint Effects Table</em> and modify your character accordingly.</p>
