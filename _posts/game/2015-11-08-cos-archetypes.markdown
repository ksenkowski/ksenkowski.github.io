		<h1>archetypes</h1>
		<p>Before we do any-thing, let me tell you this. It is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality. They cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiply-ing the evils of the world. For all that die from the preying of the Undead become themselves Undead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water... But of the most blessed of all, when this now UnDead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.</p>

			<p><strong>Archetypes</strong> are a set of <strong>Conditions</strong> and <strong>Powers</strong> that you apply to a character to either make them unique or transform them into another type of creature. Some <strong>Archetypes</strong> are themematic, reflecting a world view that drives the character. Other <strong>Archetypes</strong> reflect a physical state of being, transforming the mundane into the supernatural.</p>

				<p>The Avenger is a character who has been horribly wronged by someone acting on the behalf of the <strong>Conspiracy</strong>. The character may have been beaten, raped and left for dead, seen their parents murdered before their eyes at a young age, witnessed their spouse slaughtered in a gruesome fashion or any of a myriad of other horrific experiences. Instead of succumbing to the despair of survivor's guilt, they have nurtured their emotions into a weapon to motivate their every action.</p>
				<p>Name your <strong>Enemy</strong> and how they wronged you. That character is then created by the GM. Should you ultimately get your revenge, you must remove this Archetype and select a new one.</p>
				<h5>Conditions</h5>
				<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
					<li><strong>Myopic:</strong> When faced with your <strong>Enemy</strong> in a Skirmish, you must work to attack them until they are defeated but have a +1R to all tosses.</li>
					<li><strong>Blood Debt:</strong> When overcoming a <strong>Challenge</strong> that you know will harm your <strong>Enemy</strong> in some way you gain a +1s to your toss.</li>
					<li><strong>Not Finished:</strong> If your toss against the <strong>Aftermath Table</strong> results in your death, but your <strong>Enemy</strong> is still alive, you instead suffer from <strong>Multiple Injuries</strong>.</li>

				<p>The Beast is a character who has tapped into their feral nature. They are not so much driven by destruction as the thrill of violence against their enemies, particularly the undead. With this comes extraordinary physical abilities that set them above other humans.</p>

				<p>Pick a location on the game map for where you hide your Phylactery and keep this information to yourself. Should this location be occupied by the Conspiracy or destroyed in any way, remove this Archetype from your character and apply another.</p>
				<h5>Conditions</h5>

				<p>The Destroyer is the embodiment of the wrath of the <strong>Conspiracy</strong>. Everything they touch collapses under the weight of their wrath, and no two Destroyers are the same. Some are personifications of power, shattering obstacles in their path with brute force. Others are like wisps that float through the world, spreading rot and ruin.</p>
				<h5>Conditions</h5>
				<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
					<li><strong>Wanton Destruction:</strong> When the Destroyer attacks a target, anything that is in an adjacent square other than the Destroyer also suffers the attack. If what is attacked is an inanimate object, it is automatically destroyed (walls, ladders, statues etc.).</li>

				<p>The Explorer is a character who when faced with the actions of the Conspiracy decided to learn more. While the character fears and loathes their enemy, they can't help but be curious about it and it's mysterious purpose. Their weapon is knowledge of their enemy's ways and they seek that knowledge wherever it may lay.</p>
				<p>Unlike other Archetypes, the Explorer only has one power and no conditions. They may spend Destiny to directly introduce new information into the game at any time.</p>
			<p>To spend a <em>Destiny</em>, the player simply picks up the token used to represent it, place it on the table, and introduce a <em>Descriptor</em>. More than one <em>Destiny</em> token can be spent at any given time and can be used to augment each other.</p>
			<p>For example, when introducing a new character by declaring <em>Urik the Cup Knight is in the Inn before us</em> would cost two <em>Destiny Tokens</em>. In doing so the player has introduced a new character and placed that character in a location. If the player wanted to add them to their <em>Network</em>, they might spend another token to modify the Descriptors by saying <em>My friend, Urik the Cup Knight, is in the Inn before us.</em></p>
