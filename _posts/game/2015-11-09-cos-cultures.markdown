		<p>Culture makes people understand each other better. And if they understand each other better in their soul, it is easier to overcome the economic and political barriers. But first they have to understand that their neighbour is, in the end, just like them, with the same problems, the same questions.</p>

			<p>Creating a character begins with selecting the <em>Culture</em> that they were raised in. Doing so provides you with naming options, some basic traits, a starting language, and dictates your vocation options. <em>Cultures</em> are broken between the species groups of <em>Alfar</em>, <em>Constructs</em>, <em>Humanity</em>, and <em>Skalfar</em>. The selection found here reflects those <strong>Cultures</strong> found in and around <em>Cidiero</em>, <em>The Great City</em> and capital of <em>The Empire</em>.</p>

			<p>The Alfar are descended from Nymed, the king of a people that sailed to the world from a distant land far to the west during the First Era. They brought darkness over the world for three days and three nights, where no star shined on the world. This brought them into conflict with the Jutun, with whom they fought until the gods defeated the Jutun and banished the Alfar to the Gloom.</p>
			<p>The Gloom is said to be a sad dream of what the world will one day be. It sits on and perhaps next to the world, a gray and muted green mirror that relfects an endless melancholy. There the Alfar dwell, singing tragic dirges, laughing saddly, and trying to bring some light to their world by raising human children they have stolen. These children are treated like royalty, for they hope that one day these children raised as Alfar will break the curse of the gods and bring hope and happiness to their home.</p>
			<p>The melancholy of the Alfar has long elicited both fear and sympathy from humanity. Banished to the Gloom they live side-by-side with Humanity, crossing over only to forward their alien plans. Pale skinned with solid black eyes, when they walk among people they can almost pass as human...</p> 
			<p>Almost.</p>

			<h6>The People</h6>
			<p>Unlike most human cultures, Alfar culture is not extremely stratified. If there is any human culture they most resemble it is that of the Zeher, who are rumored to have intermarried with the Alfar during the Second Era. Like the Zeher, each Alfar finds their own calling, choosing to live out eternity as they see fit.</p>
			<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
				<li><strong>The Craftsmen</strong> Using wood and metal that holds the sad memory of better days, Alfar craftsmen create wonders. Nothing they make is not without some touch of the Wyrd, imbuing in any who touch them a fond sadness, like a memory of a lost loved one.

						<li><strong>Talent:</strong> <em>Master at crafting artifacts, Can teleport a running distance away, Earns sympathy with simple conversations</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Collectors</strong> Driven by a pathalogical need to unravel the curse set upon their people by the Gods, collectors scour the world in search of children with true joy in their hearts. They steal them away, lamenting the pain they bring when they do so, and bring them to the Gloom. There they raise them, trying feed the natural joy in their hearts to bring light to the twilight of their home.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Noble</strong> Some Alfar stand above the others, not because they are or believe the are any better than their kith and kin. They do this as a sacrifice, pushing off their own attempts at happiness in an effort to lead their people away from the sadness in their hearts.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Soldier</strong> Though the Alfar are naturally a peaceful people, war is not unknown to them. In times past, they have ridden forth to support ancient pacts, bringing terrible destruction upon their enemies. It is for this reason, soldiers are perhaps the most depressed of the Alfar.

				</li>
				<li><strong>The Whisperer</strong> Being both banished to the Gloom and cursed with immmortality, the Alfar have a long memory that they keep in song. Unlike other songs, theirs are sung in a sad whisper filled with longing for better days. It is said that depression and suicide strikes those who hear the beautiful voice of the Whisperers.

			<p>Constructs are found in every part of the world, hiding among humanity pursuing their own ambitions. Created in the mythic First Era when the Jutun ruled the land, warred with the gods, and tamed three dragons, they have survived to the present day. With the destruction of their enemies, the Jutun, and the scattering of their masters, the Witches, they were left to fend for themselves. Over time they formed their own societies and philisophical systems alien to our own. </p>
			<h4>Gargoyles</h4>
			<p>At the dawn of the of the First Era, the Jutun prince Mochgre hacked off chunks of the Sacred Mountain and breathed into them life. While they thrummed with life he shaped them into a myriad of forms, each different from the last. Their only similarity being the type of stone from which they came. Once completed, he sent them forth into the world to guard over that which he thought precious.</p>
			<p>After the destruction of their master, the Gargoyles became divided on what they should do next. Some vowed to continue their charge, guarding that which Mochgre held dear. Others, unable to resist their purpose, chose other things to stand guard over, spreading out into the world, some going so far as to hind amongst humanity.</p>
			<p>Today Gargoyles can be found anywhere in the world that there is statuary or Jutun ruins. Their structure and physical characteristics vary dramatically but they are bound together by their common compulsion to guard and protect their charge. Often they hold silent vigil over their charges, never sleeping or needing sustinence.</p>
			<h5>Names</h5>
			<p>The naming practice of Gargoyles is corruption of those used by the Jutun thousands of years ago. All Gargoyles took a Jutun name and made it their own. They couple it with a description that identifies how they guard their charge (<em>Mats the All Seeing, Sebulon the Destroyer</em>)</p>
			<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">

			</ul>
			<h5>Language</h5>
			<p>Gargoyles speak a form of Jutuni, the root language of the north. Because of this they having a passing understanding of all the child languages of Jutuni; Eskari, Isoli, Navari, Omeroni, and Tarathan.</p>

			<h6>Hellis</h6>
			<p>During the Second Era, one clan of Gargoyles took a special interest in the people known as the Hellas, even going to far as to change their name to Hellis. That culture's interests became the clan's interests and they identified places, artifacts and even families to guard and protect. They can be found throughout the Great City now, guarding their charges and enacting bloody revenge on tresspassers.</p>
				<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
					<li><strong>Kechrimpari:</strong> Forged of amber, the Kechrimpari took a strong interest in guarding the holy places of the Orthodox Church. They find a special beauty in the architecture and artwork of the religion and guard it zealously. At times this has brought them in conflict with the owners of the very places they hold dear.

Many have taken on the role as agents of Reise, protecting those who travel at night. If the Church knows if this is an official alliance between that god and these Gargoyles, they aren't telling.

			<p>In this Third Era of known history, the world is clearly dominated by humanity. Rising up in the Second Era after the Gods War brought the Jutun low and shattered their grip on the world, they have spread to all corners of the world. Humanity has been so successful that they have pushed all others to the margins, relegating many other species to the status of myth and nightmare.</p>

			<p>During the First Era the Skalfar were the most powerful and successful creation of the Jutun. Bred to be loyal servants of their masters they were trusted to act on their own initiative, supporting the war effort against the Witches and their constructs. When the Jutun were defeated, and the surviving Witches scattered by the gods, they pursued their own agenda, as each noble house spread throughout the human world, infiltrating it, and in some places openingly dominating it.</p>
			<h4>House of Koloi</h4>
			<p>Those who know what the Koloi are call them snakeheads, a feared enemy to humanity. When they are discovered, they are rightfully feared, though the idea that they can be found under every rock is a bit overstates. The truth is that it is a much more subtle reality.</p>
			<p>Members of the House of Koloi are known for their skill in remaining unseen while manipulating others to their needs. It is this skill that put them into a position to infiltrate the great city of Cidiero itself. To this end they have intermarried and taken control of seven of the noble families of the City and the surrounding countryside.</p>
			<p>For the most part, the heads of these seven families keep to luxurious country estates, issuing written decrees through the human members of their family. To the rest of the Empire, they are simply considered reclusive, which works to their advantage as their ultimate goal is to enslave the people of the West. However, this doesn't at all mean they are always an enemy to the people, but rather they have a different vision for returning glory to the Empire. This has led to some complex alliances with all manner of creatures, living and undead.</p>
			<h5>Names</h5>
			<p>The Koloi have adopted the local Hellas naming convention. They are given a single name at birth along with a patronymic (father or family progenitor given name) terminated with the suffix <em>-ides</em>. Choose your character's name and their surname (Amvelos Leoviskosides, Beka Demosides).</p>

			<h6>The Evgeni</h6>
			<p>In their infiltration of the Empire, the Koloi have adopted many of the roles of the Hellas nobility. While they are now a part of the nobility of Helloas, no member of their family has taking on the role Emperadors, Patriarchas and the great ministers of the Empire. This makes them one of the few noble families in the Empire to not do so.</p>
			<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
				<li><strong>The Arkontis</strong> are the core of the Koloi masquerading as Hellas nobility, owning vast tracts of land in the eastern half of the Empire. They are the most human looking of their kind, only exhibiting slight reptilian features, such as their eyes, patches of scales and tongue. Unlike their human counterparts, they are raised in the arts of manipulation and control. They operate through proxies, expanding their family's powerbase and moving towards the greater Koloi goal of domination.

						<li><strong>Talent:</strong> <em>Conceal their thoughts from others, Compel others to do their bidding, Become invisible in the shadows</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Cebuanides</strong> are the middle caste of the Koloi internal hierarchy. In appearance, they possess a snake head and a large muscular body. This has made them ideal for acts of violence in the name of the cause. They can move through human society while cloaked and armored, but it becomes obvious what they are when they are seen.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>The Delgyma</strong> are the true leaders of the Koloi internal hierarchy. Monstrous in appearance, looking like a large snake with powerful arms and the ability to communicate through telepathy, they guide the Koloi on their mission of dominance. Rarely seen outside the country estates of their family, they operate from afar, only appearing to wreck destruction on their enemies.
