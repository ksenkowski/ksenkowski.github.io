excerpt: "A lot of games have moved away from the importance of the gear a character has on them. I've never been one to buy into that idea. I see gear as another tool to help define who your character is."

		<p>Together we understood what terror was: you're not human anymore. You're a shadow. You slip out of your own skin, like molting, shedding your own history and your own future, leaving behind everything you ever were or wanted to believed in. You know you're about to die. And it's not a movie and you aren't a hero and all you can do is whimper and wait.</p>

			<li><strong>Imperial Watch Harness:</strong><br/><small>It is a jack with plate poleyns tied to quilt cloth with a light celata. Only members of the Imperial Watch may wear this armor without drawing attention as illegally doing so is an automatic prison sentence of 5 years.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Malin Mercenary Harness:</strong><br/><small>It is a buffcoat with a steel cuirass, leather guantlets, morion and boots. Light and flexible it is the favored harness of the Malin bodyguards and mercenaries.</small></li>
			<li><strong>2nd Age Cuirboilli Panapoly:</strong><br/><small>It is a cuirass with tassets, shoulders, vambraces, greaves, and a casque helmet. Designed for a different age, this leather and bronze armor still finds use, both ceremonially among the patricians of the Empire and by less affluent soldiers.</small></li>
			<li><strong>2nd Age Iron Panapoly:</strong><br/><small>It is a cuirass made of iron with tassets, vambraces, greaves and barbuta. Only the wealthiest warriors of the previous age could afford this armor, and as such is rarely seen as it often stays within the family of the wealthy. As a symbol of status they also provide a +1R in social situations.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Navari Mail Harness:</strong><br/><small>The common armor of the Navari is that of a mail hauberk with leather backings and an open helmet. Relatively easy to make compared to other armor types, it has spread in popularity throughout the Empire.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Imperial Infantry Harness:</strong><br/><small>It is a half plate harness with reinforced breeches, leather boots, and casque. Both the Imperial Guard and the Imperial military have adopted this harness for their foot soldiers.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Imperial Horseman Harness:</strong><br/><small>It is a three quarters plate harness over pourpoint with leather boots, gauntlets, and casque. Both the Imperial Guard and the Imperial military have adopted this harness for their calvary.</small></li>

		<p>In <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>, <em>Loot</em> is the genearic term used to describe anything of value that characters can get out of a <em>Challenge</em> or <em>Skirmish</em>. It isn't just tangible objects like gear or artifacts, but can easily be knowlege about the <em>Cell's</em> enemies, having the powerful owe you a favor, or even a new ally.</p>
		<p>Typically, <em>Loot</em> is something planned by the <em>GM</em> as the reward or <em>Twist</em> the character's receive at the end of an encounter. However, it can be just as fun to embrace a random toss of the rune stones. When doing so, compare your toss against the <em>Loot Type Table</em> then use that result to toss against the appropriate follow up table.</p>
