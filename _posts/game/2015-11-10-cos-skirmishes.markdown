		<h1>skirmishes</h1>
		<p>Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. Itâ€™s us. Only us. Streets stank of fire. The void breathed hard on my heart, turning its illusions to ice, shattering them. Was reborn then, free to scrawl own design on this morally blank world.</p>

			<p>The Skirmishes rules are designed to resolve marshal conflicts between two or more opposing forces. Each token or miniature you use represents a single participant. Each participant is a named individual with weapons, combat traits and sustain individual wounds.</p>
			<p>The units in a Skirmish are represented by a marker on the playing surface. I prefer to use wood blocks with stickers, but you can use miniatures or tokens that meet your preferences. The only requirement is that any unit that is "human sized" be sized the same.</p>
			<p>The surface for play can be virtually anything so long as it allows you to mark the terrain. Dry erase boards work great, as do chalk boards, and printed out hex maps. Terrain can be marked directly on the surface or you can use models, props or even well crafted miniature terrain to transform the surface to match the conditions of the Skirmish.</p>

		<p>When establishing your terrain, understand that the ground scale is one inch/square/hex is equal to 5 feet. This conforms with the 25mm miniature scale. You can use smaller scaled figures or tokens, but remember to keep the scale consistent.</p>

			<li><strong>Recovery</strong>
				<p>The first round of a Skirmish does not have a Recovery Phase. All other rounds start with the recovery Phase. The Recovery Phase is broken into two segments.</p>
				<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
					<li><small><strong>Vitality Recovery:</strong> Units recover Vitality equal to their Vitality Recovery.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Morale Challenge</strong> - Each Broken unit gets the chance to make a Leadership Challenge roll to try and return to the fight. Roll the unit's Temperament against a Difficulty equal 7 minus the your commander's Leadership Trait. If a unit is within 2 squares/inches of their Commander, they gain a +1R Advantage to their roll.</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Determine Tempo</strong>
				<p>The first round of a Skirmish, Tempo is determined by either the narration leading up to the Skirmish or through a Leadership Versus Challenge. In the rounds that follow, Tempo is determined by a Leadership Versus Challenge with each side counting up their total number of units. The side with more units gets the difference as an Advantage to this roll.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Movement</strong>
				<p>During the Movement phase, the side with Tempo moves their units first or defers to the other side. Deferring movement automatically gives that side Tempo for the rest of the Round. If the unit is a mounted unit, the movement value of the mount is the only value used in the Skirmish.</p></li>
			<li><strong>Range Attacks</strong><p>Any unit with a Range Weapon can shoot during the Range Attack Phase. They may not fire if they are engaged in Melee, has run, has recovered this Round, or is Stunned or Knocked Down.</p></li>
			<li><strong>Melee Attacks</strong><p>Any unit may engage in the Melee with units to their front or side that is within reach of their weapon.</p></li>

		<p>To shoot a target, a unit must have line of sight in a 180 degree arc from the front of the unit. A unit may turn freely during this Phase to change direction, such as shooting a target behind.</p>
		<p>A target that is partially obscured from the attacker has cover. Cover provides a +1R for the unit's defense roll. The terrain and other units dictate if a unit has cover or not.</p>
		<p>The range of a unit's attack during this phase is dictated by the weapon. See the Gear section for details on different weapon ranges.</p>
