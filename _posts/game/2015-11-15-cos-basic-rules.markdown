		<p>For some reason, you will no longer be the person you believed you once were. You'll detect slow and subtle shifts going on all around you, more importantly shifts in you. Worse, you'll realize it's always been shifting, like a shimmer of sorts, a vast shimmer, only dark like a room. But you won't understand why or how.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is a play on the dark gothic fantasy role-playing games I so enjoyed in the 90's. In it you take on the role of the overwhelmed but determined heroes on an impossible quest to save the world from darkness. In doing so you explore gothic castles, face tainted monstrosities, and strive against the agents of a twisted conspiracy..</p>
		<p>This is a game about being the hero. It is about drawing a line in the sand and shaking your fist against the night. It isn't about survival, but about ensuring the world's survival.</p>
		<p>In this game, one player takes on the responsibility of playing the adversaries and allies, staging the scenes, and keeping track of the flow of the game. This is the <em>Game Master (GM)</em> and it is a tough job.</p>
		<p>The other players take on the role of the <em>Cell</em> members. They are the heroes fighting against the obstacles the <em>GM</em> puts in their path. There is always at least one hero and no more than five.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is somewhat unique as it is a marriage between the structures and practices of board games and role-playing games. It has a victory condition, utilizes a turn structure for organizing play, and leverages miniatures and maps to resolve battles. It also relies heavily on atmospheric rich narration, character immersion, and player driven action to propel the game forward.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, it is a game designed to be flexible for how you manage your time. Games centered on quests imply long-term time commitments. In this case, I attempted to create a structure and format that let's you pick it up and put it down easily.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is played with rune stones, some tokens for skirmishes, pencils and paper, but that is only the bare minimum. It isn't the most exciting way to play, but it can certainly work. However, I find that games are always more fun around a comfortable table with handfuls of tokens for pools, maps, and character sheets.</p>
		<p>The ideal set up is a good sized table that can accommodate the <em>Journey Map</em> and a space to play out skirmishes. Whiteboards are always useful, and even better is putting maps under some glass in which you can write on with dry erase markers. Mix in glass beads for managing <em>Pools</em>, tokens for the <em>Journey Map</em>, and miniatures for <em>Skirmishes</em>, and you will have everything you need to really enjoy the game.</p>

			<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> uses rune stones (24 runes plus a blank, black stone representing <em>Destiny</em>) for all conflict resolution. To decide the outcome of actions taken by characters, you drop a handful of runes. Each rune counts on it's own, with a face up result being a success. Each success is then counted up for your total.</p>
			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p><em>Challenges</em> are constructed of two parts. One is a resource management mechanic tied to the character's three main resources and the other is the actual rune stones. <em>Challenges</em> occur when the <em>GM</em> says no to a player's narration of events which leads to the following steps:</p>
			<ul class="spaced-list">
				<li>The <em>GM</em> determines the type of <em>Challenge</em> the player faces
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Physical</strong> Which costs <em>Vitality</em></li>
						<li><strong>Social</strong> Which costs <em>Influence</em></li>
						<li><strong>Mental</strong> Which costs <em>Willpower</em></li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>The <em>GM</em> determines the nature of the <em>Challenge</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Opposed</strong> A struggle against an individual with agency. The <em>Difficulty</em> is an opposed toss between both parties.</li>
						<li><strong>Unopposed</strong> A struggle against forces without agency. The GM assigns a Difficulty to the <em>Challenge</em> which the player must toss against.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>The <em>GM</em> approves of the appropriate Trait to be used in the <em>Challenge</em> by both sides.</li>
				<li>The GM adjudicates what Talents are appropriate for the <em>Challenge</em>.</li>
				<li>The <em>GM</em> and <em>Player</em> each tally up and <em>Advantages</em> or <em>Disadvantages</em> they may have.</li>
				<li>Runes are tossed and the total number of <em>Successes</em> are tallied. If a rune appears that matches one assigned to a used <em>Trait</em> or <em>Talent</em>, tally an additional success for each.</li>
				<li>Whomever has the most succcesses wins</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>Twists &amp; Conditions</h3>
			<p>When a player fails the toss, the <em>GM</em> has two options they can pursue. They can either deny the character what they want (boring), give the character what they want and assign them a <em>Condition</em> or give the character what they want and add a <em>Twist</em> to their plan.</p>
			<h3>Destiny</h3>
			<p><em>Destiny</em> is a limited resource used by players to influence the direction of the game. A pool of 24 <em>Destiny Tokens</em> are placed in the middle of the table. When a player makes a toss that results with the <em>Black Stone</em>, they take a token from the pool, which they may now spend at any time.</p>
			<p>To spend a <em>Destiny</em>, a player simply picks up the token used to represent it, place it on the table, and introduce a <em>Descriptor</em>. More than one <em>Destiny</em> token can be spent at any given time and can be used to agument each other.</p>
			<p>For example, when introducing a new character by declaring <em>Urik the Cup Knight is in the Inn before us</em> would cost two <em>Destiny Tokens</em>. In doing so the player has introduced a new character and placed that character in a location. If the player wanted to add them to their <em>Network</em>, they might spend another token to modify the Descriptors by saying <em>My friend, Urik the Cup Knight, is in the Inn before us.</em></p>
			<h3>The Network</h3>
			<p>A character's <em>Network</em> consists of friends, enemies, and business associates that they can be leveraged in their war with the <em>Conspiracy</em>. The more a character has, the more <em>Influence</em> they recover in play. However, the <em>GM</em> use the <em>Sovereign</em> and their <em>Power</em> to turn one of those character's into a pawn of the <em>Conspiracy</em>. When they do so, the character is removed from the <em>Network</em> and can be used by the GM as they please.</p>

		<aside class="span-5 col">
			<h3>Difficulty</h3>
			<p>The adversity a character must overcome is called the Difficulty and is dictated by the GM based upon the context of the situation. It is either a fixed number or equal to the number of successes tossed in opposition to the character.</p>

			<h3>Definitions</h3>
			<ul class="spaced-list">
				<li><strong>Toss Modifier (+1R, -1R)</strong> Before a toss is made, add or subtract the number of Runes you get to toss as indicated by the number.</li>
				<li><strong>Success Modifier (+1s, -1s)</strong> After a toss is made, add or subtract a number of <em>Successes</em> as indicated by the number.</li>
				<li><strong>Successes</strong> The number of <em>Runestones</em> that show their <em>Rune</em> faceup in a toss</li>
				<li><strong>Failures</strong> The number of face down <em>Runestones</em> in a toss.</li>
				<li><strong>The Black Stone</strong> The one <em>Runestone</em> with no markings. When it appears in a toss, the <em>Player</em> is granted a <em>Destiny Token</em></li>
				<li><strong>Twists</strong> A change in the narrative that adds a new obstacle to overcome. They can be immediate, like <em>an ambush</em>, or a more long term issue, like the <em>loss of a primary source of income</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Powers</strong> Powers are special abilities a character can use by spending their Destiny Tokens. These Powers are only available through <em>Templates</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Conditions</strong> Are an effect that applies to a specific set of circumstances for a specific set of time. They can provide an advantage or disadvantage and can be permanent or temporary. A temporary condition lasts a number of <em>Turns</em> equal to the margin of failure and the circumstances are based on the context of the situation as interpreted by the <em>GM</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Margin of Victory</strong> The value you get when subtracting the <em>Difficulty</em> or an opponenet's <em>Successes</em> from your own when you have won a toss.</li>
				<li><strong>Margin of Failure</strong> The value you get when subtracting your successes from the Difficulty or an opponenet's <em>Successes</em> when you have lost a toss.</li>
				<li><strong>Traits</strong> They define the capabilities of characters in the game and are each related to a Rune. Each trait has a number associated with it to indicate the base number of dice rolled in a Challenge. If anything you characters wish to try does not fall under one of the traits, the GM chooses the closest approximation.</li>
				<li><strong>Talents</strong> They are special actions a character can attempt to accomplish and are related to a Rune. They represent some capability that sets the character appart from others either culturally, physically, socially or supernaturally.</li>
				<li><strong>Descriptors</strong> They describe some colorful piece of information that is true for the game. They are defined through the use of <em>Destiny Tokens</em> or by the <em>GM</em> through narration.</li>
