		<p>He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.</p>

		<p>When starting <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>, the game always begins <em>in media res</em> with the characters fleeing enemies on their way towards their destination. The destination could be any of the points on the map and even move as play goes on. The important thing is that they do have a destination and a purpose that when reached will lead to a conclusion. Defining that destination and purpose is either done by the <em>Preamble</em> (a book providing a situation and characters to get you started) you are using or by the <em>GM</em>.</p>

		<p>Taking on the role of the <em>Game Master</em> is taking on the lionshare of the responsibility in the game. The <em>GM</em> guides the flow of play, inhabits the roll of allies, enemies and everyone inbetween as well as arbitrates the rules. They lead the way through vivid descriptions of the environment and the <em>NPC</em> reactions to the <em>Cell's</em> actions.</p>
		<p>Think of the <em>GM</em> as a person leading a conversation and setting the tone of play through the Socratic method. The players will ask questions like, <em>Can Rodrigo jump to the next building?</em> or <em>Where did that bastard sneak off to?</em> It is your job to ask back, <em>How is your character trying to make that leap?</em> or <em>Where are you looking for him?</em> You continue back and forth in this manner until you get to a point of conflict where dice are rolled.</p>
		<p>The only effective way of making this conversation fruitful is to build atmosphere, mood and tone. Utilize small concise details to solidfy imagery in the minds of eveyrone at the table. Leverage all the senses in your descriptions and your game will come to life.</p>

		<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is more about the journey of the <em>Cell</em> than the final confrontation at the end of the game. The travel from their starting point to their ultimate destination is both what helps shape the narrative of their story as well as what mechanically breaks up time in the game.</p>
		<p>Each leg of the journey of the <em>Cell</em> is broken into distinct segments which are always initiated by the players, broken up in the following way</p>		
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li><strong>Set Destination and Route</strong><br/><small>The Cell chooses a destination and outlines to the Game Master the route they will take to that destination. The Game Master decides based on the distance and terrain if the proposed leg of the journey needs to be broken up into multiple legs.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Measure Distance</strong><br/><small>Using the hex map, count the number of hexes along the route the players have defined. Each hex represents 20 miles. Each hex in the journey marks the number of Challenges the Cell will have to make.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Identify Terrain</strong><br/><small>Using the Terrain Table identify the types of terrain the route will cross over. This creates the base difficulty of the Challenges the characters will have to make for each hex.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Journey Speed</strong><br/><small>Consult the Journey Speed Table. The nature of the Cell's mode of travel will modify the cost of each Challenge the characters have to toss for. Multiply the modifier by the Vitality cost of the terrain of each Challenge and round down.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Athletics Challenges</strong><br/><small>With each hex, each member of the Cell must make an Athletics Challenge. If successful, they pass through that portion of their journey uneventfully. If one player fails, future Challenges in this part of the journey suffer a cumulative +1R or the Game Master can choose to bring this leg of the journey to a halt, introducing a new Arc and location.</small></li>

		<p><em>Arcs</em> are a series of events that occur at a single location on the <em>Journey Map</em> that explore a central idea. Each <em>Arc</em> is constructed by combining a location, a conflict and the <em>Conspiracy</em>. This is done by either tossing rune stones and using the results to map out the situation with the following tables or by taking your favorite adventure, using one from a <em>Preamble</em>, or <em>one page dungeon</em> and retrofitting it to the game. </p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li><strong>Determine Location Type</strong><br/><small>There are two types of locations, Urban and Rural. Urban locations are either towns (1,000 to 10,000 residents) or cities (10,000 to a milion people). Rural locations are centered villages, manors, ruins or fortresses. The type is determined by where the Cell ends up on any particular leg of the journey.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Make The Map</strong><br/>
			<small>Randomly toss 12 rune stones and the Black Stone onto a blank piece of paper. If you desire a larger location like the Mother City, after marking all the rune stones as indicated below, continue to toss rune stones in increments of 12.</small>
				<ol class="spaced-list">
					<li><strong>Mark the location of the Black Stone</strong><br/>
					<small>This is the location of the Sinkhole. Define the Sinkhole by using the the Sinkhole table. The total number of successes dropped is equal to the strength of the Sinkhole.</small></li>
					<li><strong>Note the location of the rune stone furthest from the Black Stone</strong><br/>
					<small>This is the location of the Conspirator.</small></li>
					<li><strong>Note the location of the rune stone furthest from the Conspirator</strong><br/>
					<small>This is the location of the potential ally for the Cell.</small></li>
					<li><strong>Note each rune stone location</strong><br/>
					<small>Mark down what each location is by selecting from the appropriate table. Populate that spot on the map using the scenario's tables.</small></li>
				</ol></li>
				<li><strong>Select a Concept</strong><br/>
			<small>Select one of the five concepts and flesh it out to create the conflict that is currently plaguing the location. Hook the details into the location, assign characters to the various roles involved and place them on the map.</small>			
			</li>
			<li><strong>Create or Choose Conspiracy Agent</strong><br/>
			<small>Depending on how your game has unfolded, either create a new Conspirator using the scenario's tables or select an existing conspirator from the Litany of Heroes and make them a central part of the conflict.</small></li>
			<li><strong>Create or Choose a Potential Ally</strong><br/>
			<small>In each location, there is a potential ally available for the Cell to recruit. Create a new character using the scenario's tables or select an existing character from the Litany of Heroes and make them a central part of the conflict.</small>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Creating Sinkholes</h3>
	<p>The world in many ways is shaped by the passion and fear of those that came before. Emotions linger, warping the land and creating sinkholes of Taint. Near these sinkholes, resolve is weakened, baser instincts are embraced, and in some cases, previous acts of evil repeat through possessed mortal proxies. Using sinkholes is a key way to ratchet up the gothic horror implicet in Conspiracy of Shadows.</p>
	<p>To create a sinkhole toss three rune stones and assign the results to a column on the Sinkhole table. The Cause outlines what events occured to cause the sinkhole to appear. Manifestations are how the Sinkhole physically asserts it's will. Powers are specific abilities that can be used by individuals who successfully complete a Dominance ritual. The use of Powers do not require the character to be in the Sinkhole they have dominated unless otherwise stated. Each use automatically graints the character new Taint.</p>

		<p>Conflicts are created following the formula of <em>Concept + Location = Conflict</em>. By combining these elements and hooking them into the map you have created, the result is you have built a compelling conflict to explore.</p>
		<p>There are five common concepts to explore in <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>, which are broken down further into three examples. Each reflects the nature of the struggle of an underdog against an all powerful force. Each concept provides example situations that extrapolate on the concept and potential actors to take part in the Arc.</p>		
		<h4>Betrayal</h4>
		<p>Betrayal can play a key role in the game. It is based upon the idea that anyone can be a villain. Anyone can step over the line and expose comrades and communities to risk, and even death.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
			<li>
				<h5>Theft</h5>
				<p><small>When something of value is stolen it is hurtful, but when it is stolen by a trusted friend it is life altering. It could be a rare item, proof of innocence of a crime, or even a dark secret.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The Thief, Bounty Hunters, The Local Watch, A Detective, A Weathy Heiress, An Unscrupulous Crime Boss</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Nothing was ever actually stolen, One of the parties is a god causing trouble, The item isn't as valuable as everyone thinks</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A seedy bar filled with the worst sort, A dingy office with light flickering in the window, A dockside warehouse with deep menacing shadows</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Feud</h5>
				<p><small>One time friends or lovers now fight over an offense long forgotten. Because it has become so personal, everything has turned vicious and violent.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> Rival clan heads, Ex-lovers, Business rivals, Rival gang leaders, Rival nobles</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Someone unsupecting is responsible for the feud, Both sides have legitimate grievances, A third party will intervene if things don't change</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A guarded compound, A fight in a dingy alley, Lovers slipping away in the night</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Incompetentance</h5>
				<p><small>A priest, noble or any other ruler has become or always was incompetent. The problem is now there is a crisis and their failures have become magnified.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The ruler, A frustrated advisor, A plotting underling, The leader of the opposition</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists: </strong> A mob rises up in reaction to the ruler's actions, A coup is staged by someone unexpected, Someone covers for the rulers actions, muddying the waters</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> Grumbling unrest in the market, A fire raging through the district, Guards running in small companies</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Corruption</h4>
		<p>The slow, spiraling descent from the light into the pit of evil is a core aspect of the game. It is easy to introduce symbolism in an arc with scenes of decaying flesh, rotting wood, and other common horror trappings. Or, corruption can appear as the eroding morality of a protagonist or key supporting cast member in the face of evil.</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
			<li>
				<h5>Corrupt Leaders</h5>
				<p><small>The merchant council, local government officials or priesthood have succumbed to a greed so powerful there is no place for good folks to turn. Graft, the halting of services out of spite, and violence now rule the day.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> Corrupt officials, Innocent relative, recent victim of the corruption, misguided reformer</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists: </strong> The corruption has spawned a vigilante who hunts anyone he views as corrupt, The hidden corruption has been brought to light by scandal, Riots break out and are brutally but down</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> Overly ornate gold rings, The clink of coins in a bag, The smell of rotting garbage</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Decadence and Abuse</h5>
				<p><small>The rulers, be they nobles, wealthy merchants or priests have embraced a decadent lifestyle unheard of. Pleasure and pain mix intoxicatingly, leading to greater and greater acts of depravity.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> A bloody tyrant, A self-serving priest, An assassin waiting to strike, An innocent relative, A woman with no other options</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> A neighbor invades to destroy the decadent leaders, The last true threat to those in power is executed, A natural disaster makes things worse</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> An child covered in bruises, A room covered in fine silk, A table covered with rich foods</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Evil Awakened</h5>
				<p><small>Something that should have stayed buried has reappeared in the world. A slow corruption of the souls of those who are near creates a toxic miasma of evil.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The discoverer of the evil, The evil made manifest, An old scholar who knows too much, The apprentice not sure what to do</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> The evil is foretold with no apparent way to stop it, Those closest to you have become corrupted by it, The evil leaps from person to person and no one can be trusted</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A corpse smell in the air, A room filled with chanting cultists, A black ooze spreading</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Doom</h4>
		<p>Doom is the race against time before the sword falls on your head. It can be foretold, hanging over the characters, antagonists, supporting cast members, or the world at large. It can also be unknown, seeping into play, driving towards an ultimate, futile end.</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
			<li>
				<h5>Famine</h5>
				<p><small>Drought, monsoon rains, or blight is consuming the foodstuff of the land. It is the hand of the gods punishing the wicked, a manipulation of the weather and markets by the Conspiracy, or simply the natural cycle of the world.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong>  Divine agents of the gods, Market manipulating merchants, Master of a great farm, Peasants trying to scape by, Roving bands of violent sociopaths preying on the collapsing society</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Only divine intervention can bring the famine to an end. Riots break out in cities of the lack of food. War breaks out over the only ariable land left.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> The last shipment of grain. Great dust storms on the horizon. Stinking mud that clings to everything.</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Disease</h5>
				<p><small>A particularly viralent plague is spreading in the area. Is it a divine wind sent to sweep away the populace, a manufactured disease in service of the Conspiracy, or simply the result of trade between far off places.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> A plague worshiping cult, Incompetent physicians, Opportunistic merchants, Snakeoil Salesmen, Goverment official who has been through it before, a university trained physician, a merchant trying to escape</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> The disease can only be cured through the use of the Wyrd. Food supplies are running desperately low due to quarentine. A neighbor arrives to burn it all to the ground.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A cure in a golden vial. Piles of corpses rotting in the sun. Empty houses overrun with vermin.</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>War</h5>
				<p><small>Though any of these themes can percipitate war, when a war comes it becomes it's own struggle. It is endless, but simmering with minor skirmishes, burning hot with vast battles, or the unbearable grind of endless sieges.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> A might general, Incompetent officers, Peasants fleeing the conflict, deserters hiding in the badlands, priests attempting to mediate</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Peace could be had if only the sides would talk, but they haven't in years. The devastation is so complete that soldiers are now rare and valuable. The Conspiracy is using the war as a cover for something more sinister.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> Broken iron and burned out buildings. Mass graves. Desolate villages and fallow fields.</small></li>
				</ul>

		<h4>Struggle</h4>
		<p>Struggle is a key concept for all <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> games. Fighting a powerful conspiracy hinges on the idea of a struggle. It is rooted in both the internal struggles of characters as well as their external struggles.</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
			<li>
				<h5>Class Struggle</h5>
				<p><small>The wealthy have long been at odds with those they exploit, but now things have gotten much worse. A tension exists and at any moment violence could errupt leading to casualties on both sides of the class divide.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The reformer, The symbol of the wealthy, A downtrodden family, The judge in a bind, A corrupt  watch captain</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> The reformer has been taking bribes from the rich, An outside force is stirring up trouble among the poor, A popular populist has been arrested</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A rickety bridge ready to fall, A collapsed home, The fine carriage driving through the slums</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Ethnic Struggle</h5>
				<p><small>An act of violence sparks unrest amongst ethinic groups that once lived in harmony. Either the Conspiracy has orchestrated this for it's own purposes or is taking advantage of the unrest to accomplish something.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> Traveling Preacher, Cultural Zealot, An Oportunistic Noble, A Serial Killer, Intermarried Couple, Lone Good Watchman, Ambassador</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Unrest is fueled by a rival state unrelated to the groups involved. A fire breaks out in one ethnic quarter. The local government has taken sides in the conflict.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> >A common ground between the ethnic groups. A misinterpreted cultural practice. Stockpiled weapons.</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Government Crackdowns</h5>
				<p><small>Someone in charge has decided to crack down on the local criminal element. This opens the door for the Conspiracy to take advantage of the unrest.</small></p>
				<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
					<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> Watch commander or garrison commander, Snitch or Spy, Court official or Noble, Forester, Temple Priest, Guild Captain, Local Merchant, Bandit Chief, Smugglers</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> A third party arrives to mediate with it's own agenda. A friend is betrayed weakening their position. Former enemies now are working together.</small></li>
					<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> Confiscated goods in the wrong hands. Formly legal goods not considered contraband. Pardons available for turning in suspects.</small></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Faith</h4>
		<p>The setting of <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is built upon faith. Religion is not simply a series of beliefs, but a solid way of life to people in the world. However, the concept of Faith also covers an individual’s belief in themself and their allies.</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
				<li>
					<h5>Heretical Movement</h5>
					<p><small>A heretical movement has gained momentum locally and small skirmished have broken out over doctrine. This is fertile ground for the Conspiracy to plant itself, leading to a change in the dominant religion, replacing the dominant religion, or pushing the religious strife into full scale war.</small></p>
					<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
						<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> Leader of the Movement, Leader of the Dominant Religion, Local Nobility, Interfaith Families, Local Government Official, Guild Captain</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> One of the Cell Member's family is in the movement. The movement gains ground with a key ally. An enemy offers to join forces against the movement.</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Things</strong> Mobs of true believers clash in the streets. Burnt out churches. A river red with blood from executions.</small></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Messiah or Prophet</h5>
					<p><small>A individual of seemingly divine power walks the region, inspiring both devotion and fear. Are they sent from the gods to save us or are they a tool of some malign enterprise?</small></p>
					<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
						<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The Prophet, The Disciples, The Local Religious Leader, The Most Recently Saved, The Snake Oil Salesman</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> They are a false prophet and their acts have incured divine wrath for the region, They are a tool of the Conspiracy designed to draw out enemies, They are a true prophet of some unknown god</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Things:</strong>Feet washed in blood, A sermon in the wilderness, A fire in the church</small></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Cult Machinations</h5>
					<p><small>Just because the gods slew the Jutun and bound the Jinn does not mean these entities of power are not still worshiped among men. Are they seeking to bring their Jutun lord back to life, release the bonds of a mad Jinn, or something more sinister?</small></p>
					<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
						<li><small><strong>Enemies or Friends:</strong> The Cult Leader, The Child of a Wealthy Local, The Marked Sacrifice, The Local Religios Authority, An Agent of the Law</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Twists:</strong> Those in power are secretly members of the cult, A fire has been started to mask their great ritual, The object of their devotion actively seeks to destroy them</small></li>
						<li><small><strong>Things:</strong> A knife carved with unknown runes, A child dressed all in white, A bloody alter</small></li>
					</ul>

		<p>Arcs typically follow one of three sets of Turn structures; the Gauntlet, the Quest, and the Confrontation. Deciding upon one will go a long way in helping the Game Master both prepare the right obstacles as well as guide both the atomosphere and the pace of play.</p>
		<h4>The Gauntlet</h4>
		<p>The Gauntlet always begins with the Cell in some peril from which they must escape. The focus of the Arc is the characters themselves and their actions, not on the antagonists trying to harm them. This is a very common structure in a Conspiracy of Shadows game, as the Cell often finds itself in trouble either as a consequence of player choices or by the actions of the Conspiracy.</p>
		<p>Gauntlet Arcs work best with a pendulum style of pacing. The Arc starts in a tense series of moments with the Cell in a crisis from which they must escape without much time to think, only to act. After that moment of crisis, the pace slows a bit, allowing the Cell characters to rest and collect their breath. Then, the pace again picks up towards the ultimate end of the mission as they try to overcome the danger.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Escape from a city under siege.</li>
			<li>Escort an ally to safety.</li>
			<li>Kidnap a member of the Cult.</li>
			<li>Break into or out of a prison.</li>
			<li>Fight a running battle on the road.</li>
			<li>Escort refugees through a warzone.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Quest</h4>
		<p>The Quest structure centers on the Cell moving through a series of horrifying places in order to obtain something of value. It is very much influenced by the literary hero story arc in which the hero travels through the metaphorical wasteland to reach his ultimate goal. In this type of session, the focus is on the journey of the Cell and its interaction with the terrifying locations and horrific situations encountered. It is effectively the larger game but on a smaller scale.</p>
		<p>Quest Arcs work best as a gradual rise towards a crisis point, which can be at the end of a mission. Or, the GM can pull the rug out from under the Cell earlier as a surprise. The Arc starts off quietly, with plenty of time for planning and preparation by the Cell. As the Arc progresses, things slowly pick up as the GM throws increasingly difficult challenges at them, eventually leading to a crisis point at the end.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Find the corpse of the liche king.</li>
			<li>Destroy an unholy instrument.</li>
			<li>Rescue an important noble from bondage.</li>
			<li>Recover a lost weapon from a ruined city.</li>
			<li>Bring aid from a neighboring kingdome.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Confrontation</h4>
		<p>In a Confrontation Arc a villain directly opposes the Cell. The focus is upon the relationship between this nemesis and the Cell. Typically these Arcs only make their appearance at important milestones in the greater journey. Confrontation Arcs work best with a pendulum style of pacing.</p>
		<p>The Arc starts with a confrontation with the nemesis or their agents, but with no time for Cell to plan, only to react. After the confrontation, the Cell gets a chance to be proactive, setting the stage for the next confrontation, where the nemesis is forced to react to the Cell.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Compete for the favor of the ruler.</li>
			<li>Thwart the nemesis' illegal activities.</li>
			<li>Discover the nemesis' secret.</li>
			<li>Destroy the nemesis' most valuable asset.</li>
			<li>Force the nemesis to sign a treaty.</li>
			<li>Destroy the nemesis.</li>

		<p>As with any role-playing game, Conspiracy of Shadows requires the Game Master to be able to think fast and introduce new complications on the fly. These complications are called Twists and Conditions. Twists take the game in a new direction while Conditions hinder a character in some way.</p>
