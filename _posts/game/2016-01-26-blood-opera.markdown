		<p>While I'm waiting for the Lord to remember me, I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of "Brother" Ramirez will tell you something! You think you're better than I am... where we came from, if one did not want to die in poverty, one became a priest or a bandit! You chose your way, I chose mine. <em>Mine</em> was harder! You talk about Mother and Father... you forget that when you left to become a priest <em>I</em> stayed behind! I must have been ten, twelve, I don't remember which, but <em>I stayed</em>! I tried, but it was no good! Mow I'm going to tell you something... you became a priest because you were too much of a coward to do what <em>I</em> do!</p>

			<h2>Origin Story</h2>
			<p>Way back in 2005, shortly after releasing <strong>Conspiracy of Shadows: Revised</strong> I was trying to sort out a way to raise awareness of my game. At that time I traveled to conventions more so tried my hand at embracing conventional wisdom and run a convention game to get people to fall in love. Out of that sprung Blood Opera, a situation centered on the fall of a noble house due to murder and betrayal.</p>
			<p>Flash forward to 2015 as I began to come upon the end of what might be considered an overly ambitious project, the <strong>Tapestry Deck</strong>. For those who don't know what that is, it is a <strong>Conspiracy of Shadows</strong> themed tarot deck. I started it as a personl project, transformed it into an experiment in <a href="https://www.patreon.com/keithsenkowski" target="_blank">patronage funding</a>, and it took on a life of it's own. But I digress.</p>
			<p>The project was coming to a close, and I had promised a game for my patrons using the cards. I'm no Matt Snyder or Joe Prince. Cards aren't my strong suit and ironically enough neither is tarot decks despite designing one. So the pressure was on for me.</p>
			<p>Not known for being overly original, I reached into my bag of tricks and out came Blood Opera... again. This time I coupled it with my favorite card game (Euchre), some bright ideas from <a href="http://ndpdesign.com/online-store/microgames-print" target="_blank">Nathan</a> and created a 4 to 6 player game of intrigue.</p>

			<h2>The Rules</h2>
			<p>He wasn't a good and caring father. He wasn't a considerate and gentle lover. He wasn't a loyal and protective sibling. He was <strong>Ivar the Conqueror</strong>, a merciless general without compare that forged an empire from ash, blood and steel. And now, now he has died cloaked in intrigue and his throne remains vacant. Who in the family will take his place?</p>
			<h3>The Deck</h3>
			<p>There are three separate groups of cards in the deck. There are the <strong>Dooms</strong>, which are the twenty-one cards without suits or numbers. There are the <strong>Pips</strong>, which are the fourty-eight numbered cards of the four suits, coins, swords, fire and stars. Lastly there are the <strong>Sets</strong>, which consist of the six possible character cards and the rules cards. These sets of cards are kept separate the entire time you play.</p>
			<h3>Object of the Game</h3>
			<p>The goal of the game is to gain the most <strong>Influence</strong> each round by taking tricks. When all the possible rounds are played out (meaning all the <strong>Dooms</strong> have been used) or when a single character or alliance claims 11 <strong>Influence</strong>, the game is over. The player with the most <strong>Influence</strong> dictates the ultimate fate of the Ivar's empire and the other characters.</p>
			<h3>The Sets</h3>
			<p>To begin play each player must select a character. There must be at least four characters in play and all four suits must be represented. These cards suggest character motivations and ideas for the player to leverage during the <strong>Play</strong>, dictate turn order and trump.</p>
			<h3>Dealing the Dooms</h3>
			<p>Each player is dealt a card from the <strong>Dooms</strong> deck by the player of <strong>Magda</strong> until all of the cards have been dealt. They should mark down what they were dealt on scrap paper and hand them back to the player of <strong>Magda</strong>. That player then reshuffles the Dooms and has them cut by the player of <strong>Anatoli</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Rank of Cards</h3>
			<p>The highest trump is the 12 of the trump suit. The second highest is the 12 of the complimenting suit. Suits are grouped into two compliments; coins and stars, fire and swords. The remaining trumps rank in descending order from 11 to 1 with plain cards following in the order of 12 to 1.</p>
			<h3>The Play</h3>
			<p>The player of Magda flips over the first of the <strong>Dooms</strong>, laying it face up. This dictates who's turn it is to narrate and what suit is trump for this turn (from their card). The player of Anatoli then deals out five <strong>Pip</strong> cards to each player. They may deal them in any fashion as they like. They may deal 3 at a time then 2 at a time, 1 at a time or any other distribution so long as it is consistent.</p>
			<p>That player whose <strong>Doom</strong> card was dealt, called the <strong>Narrator</strong>, begins to describe a scene based on what is depicted in the Doom card that position their character for the throne. Other players can contribute to the scene forging alliances and adding color until one player disagrees with some element of the scene and halts the role-playing by saying, <em>There are lies mixed in with this truth.</em></p>
			<p>At this point players may choose to ally with one other player for the hand or play it alone. This is signified by exchanging a single card. Play is then lead by the <strong>Narrator</strong>, by laying a card face down in the middle. If they can, each player must follow the suit placed. If unable to follow suit, the player may trump or discard any card. A trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, or, if it has a trump, the highest trump.</p>
			<p>After 5 rounds, the scene is closed. If the Narrator and his faction has the most tricks, the point of contention falls in their favor. If there is a tie or they do not score the most tricks, the point of contention falls against them. Either state of affairs sets the stage to continue the narrative with the next flip of the Dooms cards.</p>
			<h3>Influence</h3>
			<p>Influence is the way the game is scored. It can be also be spent 1 point at a time to force a new deal of the cards. The following lists all the possible scoring situations:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
				<li>An alliance that takes 3 or 4 tricks earns 1 Influence each.</li>
				<li>An alliance that takes 5 tricks earns 2 Influence each.</li>
				<li>A lone hand that takes 3 or 4 tricks earns 1 Influence.</li>
				<li>A lone hand that takes 5 tricks earns 4 Influence.</li>
			</ul>
