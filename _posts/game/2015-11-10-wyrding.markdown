		<h1>wyrding</h1>
		<p>It is no secret. All power is one in source and end, I think. Years and distances, stars and candles, water and wind and wizardry, the craft in a man's hand and the wisdom in a tree's root: they all arise together. My name, and yours, and the true name of the sun, or a spring of water, or an unborn child, all are syllables of the great word that is very slowly spoken by the shining of the stars. There is no other power. No other name.</p>

		<p>The Wyrd is the way in which individuals tap into supernatural powers to change the world around them. It takes on two forms, the Incantations and Rituals. If a character has a supernatural Talent (e.g. <em>Sees through the eyes of ravens</em>) they can perform Incantations. Rituals are esoteric processes that anyone can participate in so long as the ritual has been discovered in some written or verbal form during play.</p>

		<p>Incantations are Wyrds that unleash magical energies quickly through simple hand movements and spoken words. Incantations of all types have four basic components; an effect, a duration, a scope, and the cost. Incantations that do not prompt an Opposed Challenge have a base Difficulty of 4, though the GM can modify this as they see fit.</p>

		<p>Incantations can have one of the following five effects. It may confuse, hinder, help, harm or manipulate.</p>
		<p>A character can create illusions that Confuse others. When using a Confuse Incantation, enter an Opposed Challenge between the character's Wyrd and the target's Temperament Trait. If successful, the target believes the illusion to be true.</p>
		<p>A character may use Incantations to Hinder a target's abilities. When doing this, the ability or abilities must be named. The Margin of Victory provides the negative Toss Modifier applied to the target.</p>
		<p>A character may use Incantations to Help themself or another. When doing this, the ability or abilities that you wish the help must be named. The Margin of Victory provides the positive Toss Modifier applied to the target.</p>
		<p>Additionally a Help Incantation can also be used to remove Conditions or Taint from a character. The Margin of Victory determines the number of Conditions or Taint that are removed.</p>
		<p>A character may use Incantations to unleash raw energy to Harm an opponent. The form in which this takes is up to the player and can have additional effects approved by the GM. For example, if it takes the form of a firey lash, it might also start nearby straw on fire.</p>
		<p>A character may Manipulate the world around them. They can move things around, knockdown opponents, lock doors and any other mundane task with the force of their will. When doing so they declare how they are trying to manipulate their target (e.g. <em>push, pull, knock down, stun, immobilize</em>).</p>
