		<p>It makes me said when I see designers treating tracking as kerning. For the most part, Typography is a lost art on the web, even though it should be treated as a first class citizen. The good news is tracking, unlike kerning, is something we can easily translate into the CSS attribute letterspacing.</p>
		<p>For the uninitiated, <strong><em>tracking</em></strong> is the adjustment of the spacing of characters throughout an entire word. When used for evil it can severly impact the legibility of the type. So use it for good people.</p>
		<code>
			letter-spacing = tracking / 1000<br/>
			0.2 = 200 / 1000<br/>
			letter-spacing:0.2px;
		</code>
