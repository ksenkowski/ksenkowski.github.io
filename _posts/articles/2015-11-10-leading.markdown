		<p>For the uninitiated, leading is the vertical distance between the baselines of each line of type. That is where a letter sits, which requires a deeper explaination I will put into an article soon. Either way, the closest correlation between this value is the CSS attribute of line-height.</p>
		<h2>Here is how we convert leading into line-height:</h2>
		<code>
			line-height = 100 * ( leading / font-size)<br/>
			0.2 = 100 * ( 72 / 26 )<br/>
			line-height:276.93%;
		</code>
