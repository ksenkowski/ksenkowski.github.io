		<p>When TSR moved on from <strong><em>The Strategic Review</em></strong> to <strong><em>The Dragon</em></strong> for the most part is was just a title change. It took some time for the writing and layout to improve. However, in these early years we get to see some interesting firsts, such as the <strong><em>Creature Features</em></strong> and the Remorhaz.</p>
		<p>This entry is notable for a few reasons. It has a striking Erol Otus illustration that sets a nice tone and precludes the need for too much descriptive text. It is also the first attempt I have seen in the magazine up to this point of actual layout.</p>

			<p>The primitive critter focused layout in this page reminds me why I love the <strong><em><a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/the-petersen-bestiary-volume.html" target="_blank">Peterson Bestiary</a></em></strong> for <strong><em>Torchbearer</em></strong>. It is free and really illustrates what can be done for page layout and monster manuals. I only wish all those old binder monster manuals were laid out like the <strong><em><a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/the-petersen-bestiary-volume.html" target="_blank">Peterson Bestiary</a></em></strong>. I would have kept them.</p>
