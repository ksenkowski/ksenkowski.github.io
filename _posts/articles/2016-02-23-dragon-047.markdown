		<p>This is a really interesting issue of Dragon Magazine. We get the first appearance of a master artist on the cover, an advertisement for one of the most influencial game companies of the time, and a full pulp heroes game called <strong>Crimefighters</strong>. Oh, and <strong>Dick Cheney</strong> sent a question to <strong>Dragon Magazine</strong> that got answered in this issue.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.johnblumenillustration.com/" target="_blank">John Blumen</a> is a fantastic artist who's work I have admired for a long time. Here we get the pleasure of seeing some of his early work (also his first for <strong>Dragon</strong>). If you hit his website in the link above you can see both how raw this cover is, but also the places he went over time.</p>
			<p>Personally I love the use of the color in this piece (mouse over to zoom in). He pulls in the warm and cool spectrum in interesting ways throughout. In particular I am captivated by the lizard mount/thing. It's eyes haunt my dreams.</p>

			<p>This advertisement for <strong>Epyx</strong> games is important for two reasons. First, look at it! It is a classic example of the <em>excited guy</em> advertisement (not to be confused with the <em>excited family</em> ad). Just look at him. That dude is super happy to tell you about <strong>Epyx</strong> games.</p>
			<p>The second reason is that this company is responsible for the creation of some amazingly influencial and important games. The most familiar are probably <strong>California Games</strong>, <strong>Summer Games</strong>, <strong>Winter Games</strong> and <strong>G.I.JOE</strong>. The ones people forget they are responsible are perhaps more important; th wide release and ports of <strong>Rogue</strong> (hence the term roguelike) and the <strong>Dunjonquest</strong> line.</p>
			<p>Oh, and the company was founded when one of the founders bought a <strong>Commodor PET</strong> to help manage his <strong>D&amp;D</strong> game. You can read about <strong>Dunjonquest</strong> <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dunjonquest/dunjonquest.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<p>I mean I can only assume <strong>Cheney</strong> sent this letter to <strong>Dragon</strong> to get clarification on torture practices. It looks like we have <strong>TSR</strong> to blame for his justification of torture.</p>

			<p>A really large section of the magazine is taken up by this article. A pulp fiction game (<strong>Shadow</strong> not <strong>Tarantino</strong>), it takes some interesting approaches to game design. <strong>David Cook</strong> is the author and I can almost see him struggling against accepted system design practices in this piece.</p>
			<p>The two most interesting bits I saw I added to the image here. The first is a experience point path based on what are essentially pulp archetypes. Instead of killing things and taking your stuff, you need to act according to your archetype to advance.</p>
			<p>The second interesting bit is the initiative system. It is tied to seconds of time and actions that are declared first. After their declaration you roll a <strong>D4</strong>, which only slightly modifies the results. Interesting stuff that wouldn't take much to extrapolate away from a combat system to a resolution system.</p>
