		<p>This epic adventure follows a young Marco Polo, who finds himself in the court of the great Kublai Khan and must navigate a world of greed, betrayal and sexual intrigue as the Mongol leader wages a bloody campaign to become Emperor of the World. Re-creating the legendary explorer's 13th century exploits in the Far East, this historical drama chronicles the intrigues, duplicity and greed running rampant in the court of the Mongolian ruler Khan.</p>
		<p class="text-right"><em>~ Amazon.com Summary</em></p>
			<p>When the first season of this show came out, I enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away. It had some serious high points, but also some wooden acting at times. Enjoyable, but not in a way that gives you the vapors.</p>
			<p>This second season though... Damn was it good. It has pushed it's way to the top of the list for Netflix produced TV shows for me and ahead of anything HBO is doing right now (though those first 20 minutes of the last episode of Game of Thrones was pretty amazing).</p>
			<p>If you gave it a try with the first season and weren't thrilled, I think you should give it one more go.</p>
