			<p><em>Drew: The Man Behind The Poster</em> is a feature-length documentary highlighting the career of poster artist Drew Struzan, whose most popular works include the Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, Back to the Future and Star Wars movie posters. Telling the tale through exclusive interviews with George Lucas, Harrison Ford, Michael J. Fox, Frank Darabont, Guillermo del Toro, Steven Spielberg and many other filmmakers, artists and critics, the journey spans Drew's early career in commercial and album cover art through his recent retirement as one of the most recognizable and influential pop culture artists of all time.</p>
			<p class="text-right"><em>~ Amazon.com Summary</em></p>
			<p>I was absolutely captivated by this documentary. It probably helps that it reinforced my own biases about how movies are currently marketed. Also my personal opinion regarding digital art (buy me a drink and I will rail against it for hours) is reflected in the movie. It is on <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> for $0.99 if you don't pay for Prime, so watch it now.</p>
			<p>Seriously. Go watch it now. I will wait.</p>
