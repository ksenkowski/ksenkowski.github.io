		<p>This issue's highlight is pretty well timed as I have just begun reading Jon Peterson's history of gaming, <strong><em>Playing at the World</em></strong>. We also just marked the 40th anniversary of the angry old man that is <strong><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></strong>. In that context, this issue moves from pretty terrible to excellent.</p>
			<h2>Now This is a Cover!</h2>
			<p>Oh thank god we are starting to see some real craftsmanship in the covers. This one by Ken Rahman, or <strong><em>Elrohir</em></strong> as he chose to call himself is really wonderful. It takes a typical fantasy trope and adds whimsy to it while also showcasing an artist at the top of his craft.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, like many issues of Dragon, the quality of the covers doesn't reflect the quality of the content. This issue is filled with lots of <strong><em>meh fiction</em></strong> and a long ridiculous article by M.A.R Barker on military formations from Tekumel. Yawn.</p>

			<h2>Uncle Gary Gives a History Lesson</h2>
			<p>This here is the meat of the issue thought. Uncle Gary, gives us a brief summation of the history of the hobby. It is both filled with positivity, anger, and a shot at Uncle Dave. I never had the pleasure of meeting the man, but I hope that he was this lovable crumugin in person too.</p>

			<h2>The Prowler</h2>
			<p>Here we have yet another gem by Erol Otus. <strong><em>The Prowler</em></strong> is one of the dumbest monsters I have seen in the magazine so far, but the illustration is wonderful. One thing I would love to see is some enterprising OSR folks take Erol's lovingly created monsters and give them some weight with stats.</p>
