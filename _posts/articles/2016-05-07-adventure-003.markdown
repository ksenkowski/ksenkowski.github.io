			<p><span class="first-letter-box"><span>W</span></span>hen I got out to California the first thing I did was look for outdoors things to do. The hiking in the bay area is amazing and it didn't take me too long to find the site, <strong><a href="http://www.redwoodhikes.com/" target="_blank">Redwood Hikes</a></strong>. After my solo quest in Big Basin I knew I wanted to tackle the <a href="http://www.redwoodhikes.com/BigBasin/S-to-S.html" target="_blank">Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail</a>. Of course being me, I wasn't going to take 3 days to do it or take the shorter route.</p>
			<p>The trick from the beginning was to do this as a one way hike, being dropped off at <em>Castle Rock State Park</em> and picked up at <em>Waddell Beach</em>. I wasn't gonna use Lyft or a cab because that would be insane. Luckily Jason was more than willing to drop me off early in the morning, spend the day golfing and surfing, before ultimately picking up my exhausted ass at the end.</p>
