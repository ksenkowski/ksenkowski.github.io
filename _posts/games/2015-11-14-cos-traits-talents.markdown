		<h1>traits and talents</h1>
		<p>It is a burden...make no mistake about that. Any great gift or power or talent is a burden and this more than any, and you will long to be free of it. But there is nothing to be done. If you were born with the gift, then you must serve it, and nothing in this world or out of it may stand in the way of that service, because that is why you were born and that is the Law.</p>

		<p><em>Traits</em> define the capabilities of characters in the game and are each related to a Rune. Each trait has a number associated with it to indicate the base number of dice rolled in a <em>Challenge</em>. If anything you characters wish to try does not fall under one of the traits, the <em>GM</em> chooses the closest approximation.</p>
		<h3>Core Traits</h3>

		<h3>Derived Traits</h3>
		<p class="first">Derived <em>Traits</em> are the resources you manage throughout play. They are pools spent to engage in <em>Challenges</em>, in <em>Skirmishes</em>, and to manipulate the <em>Wyrd</em>. Each is derived by combining specific traits. After totallying them up, be sure to add or subtract any modifications that came out of the earlier stages of the character creation process.</p>

		<p><em>Talents</em> are the method in which we define and differentiate characters, both in what they can do and in what drives them. They are a brief description of something the character is capable and good at doing. It is important that they describe only one capability.</p>
		<p>Each <em>Talent</em> is also associated with a <em>Rune</em>. When writing down the Talent also include this Rune. If while using this Talent during a toss that Rune appears face-up, the character gets a +1s.</p>
