		<p class="first">You can hear the pounding in your ears. The world seems to vibrate in dread before you eyes. Things flit in the shadows. Awful things just out of sight that defy explanation. And always, always the drumming.</p>
		<p>If you were alone in this you would have gone mad long ago. You are not sure if that is a good thing, but at least you are not alone in your knowledge. Something is coming. Something old. Something that hungers. Something that hates.</p>
		<p>If you hadn't had found that old book, you might have stayed in the Great City, the Mother to Us All, waiting for the merciful end to your suffering. But you found the book. You studied the map. You fought off the mad cultists who tried to take it back and you planned your next move.</p>
		<p>With the city only miles behind you, the five of you set out on a hard road. Each step takes you to your doom or your salvation. You don't know which, and you don't really care. All you know is you must get it, that nebulous thing that will close the gate. The thing those cultist want to keep hidden so... so <em><strong>it</strong></em> can be unleashed upon the world.</p>

		<h3>The Mountain</h3>
		<p class="first">This game is a marriage between the structures and practices board games and role-playing games, but at it's heart it is still about playing out stories. The base structure is handed to you, as are the characters and materials needed to get going, but that doesn't remove player imagination and investment. It simply frames in towards one direction.</p>
		<p>While, in this game you don't invent a character out of whole cloth, you do in fact create the character, making them all your own. In the tradition of improv, the Scenario gives you some key components and a direction, but it is up to the players to make something of it. Create unique mannerisms and voices to capture the essence of how you view the character.</p>

		<p>Gameplay is divided into three segments which are built on top of one another to tell the story of your Cell's attempt to acquire. Arcs are constructed from a number of Turns, and Turns are constructed by a number of Scenes. It is the Game Master's responsibility to manage and track all of this.</p>
		<p>Scenes are the fundamental component of play and are where all the action happens. The GM frames the scenes in which all the action occurs allowing the players to attempt to destroy <em><strong>it</strong></em>.</p>
		<p>A Turn is comprised of a number of scenes equal to the number of players at the table. It demarcates a passage of time in the game. At it's end the character's Pools are refreshed and advances are taken by the characters if appropriate.</p>
