According to the Norderins and Sarls, the Cold Gods rose up as men during mankind’s enslavement to the Jotun. They were the son of Wodan, the majordomo of the Jotun king, Skirn, and they led a general revolt that led to the destruction of the world spanning empire. Wodan’s sons,  Vajir, Vojin, and Vijir then took on a quest to find the heart of the world giant, so that they may eat its flesh and attain godhood. This they did after a twelve-year journey, after which they returned, demanding the worship of their people. To this day, the Navari and Isoli still worship them as gods, while the Omeroni and Eskari fear them as ice bound demons.

The priests of the Cold Gods are the Galgarmr, a secret sect of shamans and wild sorcerors who live a semi-hermetic lifestyle. They commune with the gods, transmitting their messages to the clan holds, which they travel to on high holy days. In times of great strife, some even take on the mantle of sorceror-warlords, leading hosts men into battle.
