				<strong><em>he Strategic Review</em></strong>  was first published in 1975 when roleplaying was really just another form of wargaming. As a lifetime game and lover of history I thought I would take a walk through time to look at the state of gaming through the lens of <strong><em>The Dragon</em></strong>.</p>
			<p>This of course meant diving first into <strong><em>The Strategic Review</em></strong>, a magazine, prior to this effort, I knew very little about. There are lots of interesting bits to be found and the following are the highlights.</p>
			<h2>Volume 1, Issue 1</h2>
			<p>I think the <strong>Mind Flayer</strong> found in this issue may be the first appearance in print of the beast. However I found this solo dungeon adventure for <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> much, much more interesting bit of history.</p>
			<p>Following this gem, there are two full tables for random room generation. The interesting part though is in the text presented here. Basically a GM/DM-less game, I like to imagine people anxiously waiting for encounter envelopes from people across the country so they can add some spice to their solo game.</p>
