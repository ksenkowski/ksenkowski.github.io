				began what I thought would be a short experiment in card design in 2013. I had always wanted to create my own Tarot Deck and dipped my toes in that fall while I was fumbling around looking for something to do. I also was looking to relearn how to work in color. The previous decade I had spent working mostly with black ink in various ways and wanted to flex atrophed muscles.</p>
				<h2>The Dooms</h2>
			<p>Honestly, this was all driven by me overpaying for illustration markers and illustration paper and not knowing what to do with it. I started without a true plan for what cards I was going to make and simply decided upon <em>The Fool</em>. He was quickly followed by <em>The Dark Master</em>, <em>The Shepherd</em>,<em>The Traitor</em>, <em>The Innocent</em>, and <em>The Puppet</em>, which were all done on the "right" side of the paper. You can tell by looking at these pieces by how the colors aren't as blended that the paper was toothier.</p>

			<p>After hammering out these six something kind of magical happened. I accidently used the "wrong" side of the paper, which is all glossy and doesn't absorb the ink as readily. Suddenly a somewhat unsatisfying exprience became magical. You could see the "brush" strokes and blend colors. That colorless blender became useful.</p>

			<p>I knew I wanted to do a Ghost and I knew that I wanted it to be transparent. What I didn't know what how the hell I was going to pull that off. I'm not sure what made me think to grab some vellum and draw it on there in blue marker, cut it out and glue in on the illustration, but I am glad I did. It wouldn't be the last time I use this technique and it harkens back to my copious use of collage in college.</p>

			<p>At some point I realized that this was moving from an experiment and decided on making a thing. Really it ended up being multiple things, but either way I needed to design the back of the cards. As you may have guessed ravens have a strong visual influence on what I make, so I started with the idea of that being central to the card.</p>
			<p>From the Ravens I moved to the idea of the Fates, mixed in some Norse influence through the wolves and trees, and wrapped it in the art deco via medieval illumination style I had been cultivating for the design of all of this. In the end, I came up with something I was happy with, but not something that was easy to print out effectively, I later learned.</p>

				<figcaption>I may not be an original, but I sure as hell can remix multiple influences into a cohesive idea.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>From that point onward, the <em>Dooms</em> (High Arcana for Tarot folks) of the Tapestry Deck just sort of flowed from one idea into another. I wanted to capture primarl archetypes and decided to ignore a lot of what makes Tarot decks hum. This was my own thing, built on my own weird mix of mythology that had come out of my other art, game design, and fiction.</p>

			<h2>The Suit of Swords</h2>
			<p>As I begain to plan the actual suits and design the icons for each, I stumbled on the idea of telling a story rather than showing the number of <em>X</em> on each card. While I have seen really clever renditions of tarot cards with 10 swords on them, it really isn't my thing. So instead I pictured in my head a warrior woman and her journey.</p>
			<p>I made a conscious choice to use a woman, and a woman of color in particular, as the focus of the story I wanted to tell. That choice was in one part a response to all of the male heavy driven fantasy art and in another part to challenge me as an artist.</p>
			<p>I get dudes. I get white dudes with swords. I'm a white dude with a sword, so telling my story easy and frankly not that exciting. However, telling the story of a woman of color in a fantasy world without objectification is compelling. Who doesn't want to make compelling art or tell compelling stories?</p>

			<h2>The Suit of Flames</h2>
			<p>While I was planning out the <strong>suit of swords</strong>, I knew I wanted to tell the next part of her story. When I eventually decided she would have a child I knew I wanted to go full lone wolf and cub, taking a warrior mom and her son and watch him grow up in the context of surviving the horrors of the world I invented. The two of them are important and targets and kind of like <em>Terminator 2</em>, they are always on the run... until they are not.</p>
