			<p>I was absolutely captivated by this documentary. It probably helps that it reinforced my own biases about how movies are currently marketed. Also my personal opinion regarding digital art (buy me a drink and I will rail against it for hours) is reflected in the movie. It is on <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> for $0.99 if you don't pay for Prime, so watch it now.</p>
			<p>Seriously. Go watch it now. I will wait.</p>
