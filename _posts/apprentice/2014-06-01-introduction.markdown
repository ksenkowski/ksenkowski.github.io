<p class="first">There can only ever be one Master Galgarmr and one Apprentice at any given time. This is the law set down when the Jutun ruled the north with their alien sorcery. Thus, the Apprentice did as he should, seeking to strike down his master and replace him. He failed and was sacrificed to the Cold Gods. Shackled to an iceberg, he was cast adrift to freeze as a proper sacrifice. He refused. In the dark, frigid north he found an icebound ship with 4 starving Noderin warriors on a quest to destroy a great evil… His Master.</p>


<ul class="unstyled">
<li>How will the Apprentice and the warriors survive the hardships of the north?</li>
<li>What horrors lie in wait for them on their quest?</li>
<li>Will the Apprentice become the Master and betray his allies?</li>
<li>Will he give in to Hatred and begin the cycle anew?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Selecting Roles</h4>
<p><em>Conspiracy of Shadows: Apprentice</em> is intended for three to nine players who will play out the confrontation between the <strong>Apprentice</strong> and the <strong>Master</strong> together with their respective followers. Prior to play beginning, each player must select a role in the following order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>One player must represent the Master.</li>
	<li>One player must represent the Apprentice.</li>
	<li>One player must represent one Warrior member of the Warband.</li>
	<li>One player must represent one member of the Minions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any Warrior character not chosen, does not appear in the game. If there are more than 6 players, the remaining players choose from among the Master’s Minions. Any Minion not chosen by a player is controlled directly by the Master.</p>
