<h3 class="text-center">Glorious Battle</h3>
<p class="first">At any time in the game, when a character is facing another named character except the Master, he may call for Glorious Battle. In this case, the normal Challenge resolution is tabled and the characters enter into a one-on-one combat event. Instead of events centering on a single Throw, a series of Throws happen simultaneously in this fight to the death.</p>
<p>The player who called for Glorious Battle first describes his attack in a single sentence and through that description defines what Trait he is using.</p>
<p class="call-out text-center">Freya and Geri, after stalking Sir Ulric through the woods around the Aery for hours, finally pounce when he stops to give his mount a drink at a bubbling stream.</p>
<p class="first">In the above example the player of Freya is leveraging her Hunter Trait [6], her Loyal Wolf Resouce [2], and her Wolf Friend Talent. This means her Throw is 8 Rune Stones with the opportunity to gain further successes if any of those stones come up with Runes that match her Trait, Resource or Talent. </p>
<p>The player of Sir Ulric, which is always the player who brought the character into the game, now describes his defense with a single sentence. This description defines the Trait he will be using.</p>
<p class="call-out text-center">Sir Ulric looks up, forewarned by his mount’s sudden skitishness, draws his sword and gives out a war cry damning Freya to the Hell of the One God.</p>
<p class="first">In the above example, the player of Sir Ulric is leveraging his Hirdmann Trait [5] and his Shining Sword Resource [1]. This means his Throw is 6 Rune Stones with the opportunity to gain further successes if any of those stones come up with Runes that Match his Resource or Trait. </p>
<p>The character who throws highest deals damage to his opponent, bringing him closer to Valhalla’s Calling. The damage is equal to the difference between the two throws. The Glorious Battle continues like this until either one of the two warriors answers Valhalla’s Calling (12), or one of the warriors flees in shame.</p>
<p>A character that flees in shame is branded a Coward. This brand lasts with him until he redeems himself, forcing him to Throw one less Rune Stones in all Throws. Redemption can only be earned by winning two Glorious Battles whose tales drown out those of the character’s earlier shame.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Valhalla’s Calling is not a measure of how much punishment a character can take. It is a measure of how close a character is to having his fate come to pass. The three Fates only draw your thread out for so long before one of them cuts it.</p>
