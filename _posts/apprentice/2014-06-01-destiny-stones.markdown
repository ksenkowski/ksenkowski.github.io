<h3 class="text-center">Destiny Stones</h3>
<p class="first">The game requires 20 stones or other tokens to represent Destiny. Each character begins with a set number of Destiny Stones and will spend and earn more throughout play. </p>
<p>When Destiny Stones are spent they are placed in a pool on the table and are taken from this pool when earned. If there arenâ€™t any stones in the pool when Destiny is earned, the player gets nothing.  Destiny grants the player the power to change the game world and introduce new elements, characters, and facts into the fiction.</p>
<p>When Used, Destiny Stones allow you to bring into play anything not already identified on the various character sheets, on the map or in the Locations section of this text. They are spent at a cost of one per defined element of the game. An element is a single person, place or thing that is be given a single adjective for no additional cost. </p>
<p class="call-out text-center">Sir Ulric, the Cup Knight</p>
<p>In the above example I have created a named character who is a Cup Knight. This means he gains the benefit of any additional descriptors already tied to the Cup Knights, be they in this text or created through game play. For this reason it can be effective to tie new elements to existing elements, as the new element inherits all of the characteristics already defined in the game.</p>
<p>Destiny Stones are earned in one of two ways. Each time the Black Stone (the blank stone for generic store bought sets) falls during one of your Throws, you earn a Destiny Stone. You also earn one when you create an evocative Trait description  when engaging in a Challenge.</p>
