<h4>Heroics</h4>
<p class="first">Heroics are specific abilities defined as a paragraph on their character sheet. Each one has itâ€™s own mechanical description which defines how it works. They are unique to that character and do not require a throw to use.</p>
<h4>Talents</h4>
<p class="first">Talents describe something extraordinary about the character. They are used as part of a Challenge where they will provide an extra success should their Rune appear in a throw.</p>
