<h3 class="text-center">Endgame</h3>
<p class="first">The last turn of the game begins when the Apprentice and his Warband feel they have built up enough Resources in their estimation to confront the Master in his own lair. Facing the Master in his lair is not done lightly as failure here means the end of the Apprentice and possibly the entire Warband. </p>
<p>During the Warbandâ€™s Trial Declaration Phase, the Apprentice declares that the final confrontation is at hand, and that he and the Warband are moving to face the Master. The Master then describes his lair and the Resources that are arrayed there to defeat the invaders. The Challenge Phases are then followed in the same order as the rest of the game and do not end until either the Master or the Apprentice is defeated.</p>
