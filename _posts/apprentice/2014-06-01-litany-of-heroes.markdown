<p class="first">The Litany of Heroes serves as living narrative of the trials and tribulations of the Apprentice and the Master while also serving as a mechanical record of everything in play. It marks every Challenge overcome and every Glorious Battle by every character in the game. The document is created collectively by every player in the game. It is the responsibility of each player to write down a narrative of the events their character was a part of in this single document. </p>
<p>If something is not recorded in the Litany of Heroes, it did not happen, literally. If at any time you fail to mark something down during the game, all of the results are forfeit. You must roll back any changes to your character sheets. This is not negotiable.</p>
