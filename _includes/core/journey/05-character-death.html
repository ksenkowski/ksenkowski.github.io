		<h3>Character Death</h3>
		<p class="first">When a character is killed in play, that is not the end of the game for that player. As a player you have two choices. You can play a member of your deceased character's Network or you can play a member of one of the other player's Network. In doing so you create the character as per the standard rules if the character hasn't already been fleshed out.</p>
