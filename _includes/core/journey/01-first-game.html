		<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
		<p class="first">When starting <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>, the game always begins <em>in media res</em> with the characters fleeing enemies on their way towards their destination. The destination could be any of the point on the map and even move as play goes on. The important thing is that they do have a destination and a purpose that when reached will lead to a conclusion.</p>
