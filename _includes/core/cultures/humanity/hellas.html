			<h4>Hellas</h4>
			<p>In Hellas legend, Helios led the first of his people to Hellas Peninsula after the fall of the Jutun kingdom of Gigir. There they established the great cities of Ennea, Lofos, and Gatos. In time the city-states of the Hellas eventually spreading across to Sana Minor and the Matilado Sea, building colonies and battling for supremacy with the peoples of the south. The apex of their expansion came under Arkos of Narus, who spread Hellas culture as far south as the River Santu through conquest. Though his empire did not last after his death, the influence of the Hellas culture does to this day in all the lands their feet have touched.</p>
			<p>The Hellas were among the first people to be conquered by the Empire, but in contrast to the Empire's other conquests, the Hellas culture was elevated to stand just below the imperial Vorish culture. Every noble had a Hellas tutor for his children, Hellas sailors dominated the Imperial Navy, and Hellas became the language of the Orthodox Church. Ironically, these roles have since reversed in the Empire, with those of Hellas descent dominating the Empire establishing Hellene as the language of the court and Vorish as the language of the Church.</p>
			<p>Today those who consider themselves Hellas come from lands both in the Empire and far to the south in the Kalifate and beyond. Their physical characteristics may vary dramatically, but they are all bound by a common language, a common reverence for education, and a respect for the power of the sea.</p>
			<h5>Names</h5>
			<p>The naming practices of the Hellas has not changed since the most ancient of days. Even the overwhelming influence of Vorish culture on these people has not forced them to change the ways in which they identify one another. The Hellas are given a single name at birth along with a patronymic (father or family progenitor given name) terminated with the suffix <em>-ides</em>.

			<h6>The Evgeni</h6>
			<p>In many ways, the Empire is split in two, between the Vorish territories in the west and the Hellas territories in the east. In the eastern half of the Empire, a small number Evengi rule a vast number of people with virtually no representation in the state. From their number come the Emperadors, Patriarchas and the great ministers of the Empire.</p>
			<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
				<li><strong>The Arkontis</strong> are the core of the Hellas nobility, owning vast tracts of land in the eastern half of the Empire. Raised in the arts of war, philosophy, and theology, they serve the Emperador in the Gerosa, a body that suggest laws for ratification.

			<h6>The Doulosi</h6>
			<p>The Hellas incarnation of the Orthodox Church has a distinct flavor drawn from the culture's long past of supporting muliple schools of philosophy. At times this has put the Emperador in Cidiero and the Patriarch at odds leading to the occasional theological crisis. Like the Vors, the Hellas deny the Last Prophet and raise up the trinity of Vajir, Vojin and Vijir above the rest of the Twenty Four. However, due to the their more mystical approach to religion, they are more tolerant of variance in the canon.</p>
				<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
					<li><strong>The Anakriti</strong> make up the backbone of the Orthodox Church in the east. They serve as conduits to the Twenty Four, as political advisors, as educators, and as soldiers. They simultanesouly live both within society and outside of it as they ultimately answer to the Emperador and no one else.

			<h6>The Stratiogi</h6>
			<p>Just as in the western half of the Empire, the Stratiogi are a unifying force. There, men and women of any class can try to make their fortune and start a new life. Cultural and social differences fall away when faced with twenty years of service fighting against threats both within the borders of the Empire and without.</p>
