			<h4>Zehar</h4>
			<p>The Zehar are a people that seem to predate history. All known records account for them living in the mountains north of the Great City, never knowing the conqueror's boot, but joining first the Hellas expansion under Arkos of Narus then later the Empire as it extended it's borders. Followers of the Great Cycle, they are seemingly uncaring of world politics.</p>
			<p>While many other cultures follow some form of the Great Cycle in which a finite number of souls reincarnate eternally, the Zehar take this belief to an extreme. They believe they live the same life over and over again. The place and people may change over time, but the story of their lives remains constant.</p>
			<p>When a Zehar reaches a certain point in their life, it is said they have reached the Moment of Knowing. It is at this time they realize the path their life must take, be it glorious, infamous, or mundane. From then on they work to live out their story, which is part of the Ballad of the Great Cycle.</p>			
			<h5>Names</h5>
			<p>The Zehar use a purely descriptive surname that they don't take on until their Moment of Knowing. This means most Zehar simply go by their first name, with perhaps a general descriptor, such as Ayfem the baker of Eethel. However, when they have their moment of knowing, they take on the famed descriptor of their soul regardless of it's reflection of their physical nature (Ahlahr the Small, Sayvah the Vor Slayer, etc).</p>

			<h6>Ottiti atto Avopheia</h6>
			<p>In the time of the Tower of Atrahasis, the Ballad of the Great Cycle deemed that the people of the song split between two great houses. Those whose song wove a tale of adventure, mischief or glory became a part of the Ottiti atto Avopheia. It is the home of great warriors, cunning criminals and the leaders of communities great and small.</p>

			<h6>Ottiti atto Auttin</h6>
			<p>Not all tales in the Ballad of the Great Cycle require wars, violence and base trickery to entertain God. The struggle of the artist to create, the cultivator to provide, and the healer to bring peace is just as important. Those whom the song has moved to these professions are of the Ottiti atto Auttin</p>
