		<h3>The Wyrd</h3>
		<p class="first">The Wyrd is the way in which individuals tap into supernatural powers to change the world around them. It takes on two forms, the Incantations and Rituals. If a character has a supernatural Talent (e.g. Alchemist, Cultist, Wise Woman, Herbalis, Necromancer, Wyrind) they can perform Incantations.  Rituals are esoteric processes that anyone can participate in.</p>
		<p>Wyrds of all types have five basic components; a subject, an effect, a duration, the cost and the runes.</p>
