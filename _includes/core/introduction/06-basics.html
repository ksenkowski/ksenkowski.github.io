			<h3>The Basics</h3>
			<p class="first"><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> uses rune stones (24 runes plus a blank, black stone representing Destiny) for all conflict resolution. To decide the outcome of actions taken by characters, you drop a handful of runes. Each rune counts on it's own, with a face up result being a success. Each success is then counted up for your total.</p>
			<h4>Difficulty</h4>
			<p class="first">The adversity a character must overcome is called the Difficulty and is dictated by the GM based upon the context of the situation. It is either a fixed number or equal to the number of successes tossed in opposition to the character.</p>
			<h4>Challenges</h4>
			<p class="first">Challenges are constructed of two parts. One is a resource management mechanic tied to the character's three main resources and the other is the actual rune stones. When a character falls into opposition with the Game Master, meaning the Game Master has decided to say no to the player's narration of events, the GM first determines what kind of Challenge the character must overcome.</p>
			<p>Challenges fall into three broad types; Physical, Mental and Social. These categories dictate how many successes the player must toss, the type of  Condition that may be assigned them should they fail, and the cost to the character's appropriate resource. Vitality is required to engage in any physical activity, Influence for any social activity, and Willpower can be used for any physical, mental or Wyrding activity.</p>
			<p>To resolve a Challenge the player toss a number of rune stones equal to the Trait appropriate to the Challenge plus or minus runes as dictated by Advantages (+1R) and Disadvantages (-1R). Advantages and Disadvantages are the result of environmental effects, the character's Talents, and Conditions from by previous Challenges. If the rune of a used Trait or Talent appears in the toss, for each one appearing you get an additional success (+1s). If the toss is opposed by another character directly, the Difficulty is the number of success the opponent makes with their own toss.</p>

			<h4>Twists &amp; Conditions</h4>
			<p class="first">When a player fails the toss, the GM has two options they can pursue. They can either deny the character what they want (boring), give the character what they want and assign them a Condition or give the character what they want and add a twist to their plan.</p>
			<p>A Twist is a change in the narrative that adds a new obstacle to overcome. They can be immediate, like an ambush, or a more long term issue, like they lose of a primary source of income. They are opportunities to take the game in new and interesting directions and to add some additional excitement.</p>
			<p>A Condition is a disadvantage that applies a -1R to a specific set of circumstances for a specific set of time. The time is lasts a number of Turns equal to the margin of failure and the circumstances are based on the context of the situation as interpreted by the GM.</p>
			<h4>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages</h4>
			<p class="first">An Advantage is a bonus to the character's toss. It is indicated with a +1R, +2R, etc. This means that you add that number of rune stones to any toss covered by the Advantage.</p>
			<p>A Disadvantage follows the same pattern, but with the opposite effect. It is indicated with a -1R, -2R, etc. This means that you subtract that number of rune stones to any toss covered by the Disadvantage.</p>
			<h4>Success Modifiers</h4>
			<p class="first">Success modifiers add or subtract to your total number of successes without being tied to a specific toss. This is indicated with a +1s, -1s, etc. Doom is a prime example of a success modifier.</p>
			<h4>Margin of Victory</h4>
			<p class="first">The margin of victory indicates the result you get when you subtract the Difficulty or the total number of successes of loser in a Challenge from the total number of successes of the victor.</p>
			<h4>Margin of Failure</h4>
			<p class="first">The margin of failure indicates the result you get when you subtract the total number of successes of the loser in a Challenge from the Difficulty or the total number of successes of the victor.</p>
			<h4>Traits</h4>
			<p>Traits are what define the capabilities of characters in the game and are each related to a Rune. Each trait has a number associated with it to indicate the base number of dice rolled in a Challenge. If anything you characters wish to try does not fall under one of the traits, the GM chooses the closest approximation.</p>
			<h4>Talents</h4>
			<p>Talents are special actions a character can attempt to accomplish and are related to a Rune. They represent some capability that sets the character appart from others either culturally, physically, socially or supernaturally.</p>
			<h4>The Network</h4>
			<p class="first">A character's Network consists of friends, enemies, and business associates that they can be leveraged in their war with the Conspiracy. It consists of an Inner Circle and an Outer Circle. The Inner Circle holds a maximum of three individuals that are protected from the actions of agents of the Conspiracy. The Outer Circle holds a maximum of four individuals that are not protected from the GM.</p>
			<p>A character can move individuals between these two Circles before the start of any Arc so long as their is space. If your Circles are full you need to remove a character first. This leaves the character you removed open to be subverted by the Conspiracy.</p>
			<h4>Destiny</h4>
			<p class="first">Destiny is a limited resource used by players to influence the direction of the game. A pool of 24 Destiny tokens are placed in the middle of the table. When a player makes a Toss that results with the Black Stone, they take a token from the pool, which they may now spend at any time.</p>
			<p>To spend a Destiny, a player simply picks up the token used to represent it, place it on the table, and introduce a Descriptor. Descriptors describe some colorful piece of information that has now become true for the game. More than one Destiny token can be spent at any given time and can be used to agument each other.</p>
			<p>For example, when introducing a new character by declaring <em>Urik the Cup Knight is in the Inn before us</em> would cost two Destiny tokens. In doing so the player has introduced a new character and placed that character in a location. If the player wanted to add them to their Network, they might spend another token to modify the Descriptors by saying <em>My friend, Urik the Cup Knight, is in the Inn before us.</em></p>
