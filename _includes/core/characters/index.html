			<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
			<p class="first"><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is intended for three to six players who will play out the confrontation between the Cell and the Conspiracy. Prior to play beginning, one player takes on the role of the Game Master and the other players take on the role of a Cell member.</p>
			<p>There are two methods for taking the role of a Cell member. The first method is to select one of the premade characters from a scenario and start playing. The other method is to create your character from scratch. Regardless of the method you use, it is your responsibility to take that character and bring them to life through play. You frame the character's actions, meet challenges, and play to the character's motivations.</p>
			<p>The Game Master has the more daunting task of pacing the game, framing scenes, and providing much of the color of the world the characters are journeying through in <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>. In this way it is much like the role of a GM in other role playing games only with a specific structure and archetypes to work with.</p>
