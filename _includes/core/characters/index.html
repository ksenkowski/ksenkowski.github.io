			<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
			<p class="first"><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is intended for three to six players who will play out the confrontation between the Cell and the Conspiracy. Prior to play beginning, one player takes on the role of the Game Master and the other players take on the role of a Cell member.</p>
			<p>The Game Master has the more daunting task of pacing the game, framing scenes, and providing much of the color of the world the characters are journeying through in <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em>. In this way it is much like the role of a GM in other role playing games only with a specific structure and archetypes to work with.</p>

			<h4>Character Creation Steps</h4>
			<p class="first">Creating a character is done through a combination of chance and careful selection. It begins with each Player taking a turn at tossing 10 rune stones. The results are then used to select the character's details concerning their culture, social class, birthplace, family details, details concerning their childhood, their dirty secret, their personal affectation, a life defining relationship, the language they speak and their foretold doom.</p>
			<p>Once that is done you have yourself a character of 15 years of age. You can age that character further by making a toss of one rune stone against the Life Event's table for every 5 years. You may do this as many times as you please, understanding that the character can be no older than 65 and that the character's age will impact their Traits.</p>
			<p>The character is then rounded out by tallying up their Traits, selecting two talents, and purchasing Gear. Once done you are ready to start playing.</p>
