<h4>Malins</h4>
<p class="first">Malin legend holds that they, as a people, were originally from a land they called Paleki. There they were a soft people living in a soft land of milk an honey. A people used to Paradise on earth, having avoided the machinations of the Jutun, the First Men, or even the Ilan Adam, whom legend says they lived on the edges of Paradise.</p>
<p>This tranquility changed with the great flooding caused by the melting ice that heralded the end of the Jutun. This flooding washed the wards away from the Cin-Seytan Gate, allowing the Jinn to escape their infernal prison. They invaded Paradise, harvesting the Malins, transplanting them to the Great Waste, weeding out the weak and shaping Malin society.</p>
<p>When the Last Prophet (293 3E) came out of the most desolate parts of the wastes to unite the Malin Oymaqs (extended families) against their Jinn overlords, the Malins began to take on the shape they hold today. Over 600 years later, the Malins are still a hard  people who adhere to traditions that blend the merciless violence of their time under the Jinn with the religious zeal of the followers of the Last Prophet and the opulence of their neighbor and rival, the Empire.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The naming practices of the Malins is deeply tied to their transplantation to the Great Waste. First names are granted at age 15, reflecting some aspect of their personality. Surnames reflect a conjunction (<em>-ib-</em>) of the father's first name, the name of origin of the individual's Oymaq, and the individual's grandmother (Panah Negar-ib-Deylaq-ib-Inara).</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Language</strong><br/>The Malins natively speak Ayun, one of the most common languages in the world. Because of this they also have a passing understanding of the other Duni languages, Hazan, Hanud, and Ranka.</p>
