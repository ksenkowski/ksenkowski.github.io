<h4>Malins</h4>
<p class="first">Malin legend holds that they, as a people, were originally from a land they called Paleki. There they were a soft people living in a soft land of milk an honey. A people used to Paradise on earth, having avoided the machinations of the Jutun, the First Men, or even the Ilan Adam, whom legend says they lived on the edges of Paradise.</p>
<p>This tranquility changed with the great flooding caused by the melting ice that heralded the end of the Jutun. This flooding washed the wards away from the Cin-Seytan Gate, allowing the Jinn to escape their infernal prison. They invaded Paradise, harvesting the Malins, transplanting them to the Great Waste, weeding out the weak and shaping Malin society.</p>
<p>When the Last Prophet (293 3E) came out of the most desolate parts of the wastes to unite the Malin Oymaqs (extended families) against their Jinn overlords, the Malins began to take on the shape they hold today. Over 600 years later, the Malins are still a hard  people who adhere to traditions that blend the merciless violence of their time under the Jinn with the religious zeal of the followers of the Last Prophet and the opulence of their neighbor and rival, the Empire.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The naming practices of the Malins is deeply tied to their transplantation to the Great Waste. First names are granted at age 15, reflecting some aspect of their personality. Surnames reflect a conjunction (<em>-ib-</em>) of the father's first name, the name of origin of the individual's Oymaq, and the individual's grandmother (Panah Negar-ib-Deylaq-ib-Inara).</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Language</strong><br/>The Malins natively speak Ayun, one of the most common languages in the world. Because of this they also have a passing understanding of the other Duni languages, Hazan, Hanud, and Ranka.</p>

The chief of these judges is the Khale Kesis, elected from the great houses, they serve for life guiding the Khalifate and overseeing the rest of the Uyanlar. In the Khalifate, religion is even more tightly interwoven in society than that of the Empire.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
	<li><strong>Cenaz</strong><br/><small>When Jinn are suspected as the cause of unrest, the dreaded Cenaz step forward to bind or destroy them. The only group in the Malin world allowed to learn the Wyrding, they are both despised and needed.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>

	</ul>
<h6>Isiler</h6>
<p class="first">The majority of the population of the Khalifate comes from the Isiler and most stay within the profession of their forefathers. While not as segmented as the Empire, Malin culture tends to have little social movement. It is not unheard of for a Coban to be adopted into a Secilmis house, but few are motivated with that level of ambition.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
	<li><strong>Coban</strong><br/><small>Malin culture has long been that of the nomadic herdsman, traveling deserts and savannas searching for water an fodder for their flock. The hard conditions of this life have made the Coban a harsh people unsurprised by conflict.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>
	<li><strong>Ciftci</strong><br/><small>While images of camel caravans and vast herds of sheep are what come to mind when imagining the common Malin, there is a sedintary aspect of their world as well.

	</ul>
<h6>Alinan</h6>
<p class="first">Malin society has always been built on the backs of those who have no choice but to serve. Taken from all over the world, Alinan are raised knowing that they are property to be disposed of as their master pleases. No more, no less.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
	<li><strong>Kole</strong><br/><small>It is somewhat surprising that Malins would arm the Alinan and train them to be elite soldiers. However the conditioning is so absolute that only twice in the long history of their use has there been an uprising of Koles.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +0</small></li>
	<li><strong>Elnek</strong><br/><small>Castrated at a young age, the Elnek are often the only individuals trusted among the Uyanlar.
