<h4>Vors</h4>
<p class="first">Despite centuries of forsaking the religions of the founders of their people and following the 11 Prophets of the Gods for centuries, the Vors still cling to their mythic origins. The myth is that Acacio, a former slave to the First Man sorcerer Vorti, fled from the east, leading his people to settle in what is now Greater Voria, where he courts Lavinia, the daughter of a local king called Alecto. They myth is filled with lust, betrayal, family drama, and the ideas that would lead to the foundation of the world's first republic.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Vorish Republic, they would conquer the civilized corners of the West, consuming the once sprawling Hellas world. When religious zealotry tore the Republic to pieces, an Empire rose in it's place under the leadership of stout military commanders. The Empire has since reinvented itself several times over, eventually moving from having a Vorish character to having a Hellas one.</p>
<p>Despite the changing nature of the Empire, the Vorish people still make up the bulk of the population and having an old name still opens many doors closed to others. The imperial bureaucracy is still managed by Vorish men of quality, though the language of the court is now Hellan. However, the lingua franca as well as the controlling forces of the Orthodox Church are Vorish.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>Vorish surnames have developed over time from simple patronymic designations to a complex, three part descriptor. Each surname is a conjunction of the father's first name, the mother's first name, and either the patronymic of the founder of the family line in the case of the nobility and powerful merchants, or a place of origin. The patronymic and matronymic always ends with one of the following suffixes; <em>-as, -es, -is, or -os</em> and they are separated by <em>eta</em>. The final descriptor is separated from the rest of the surname with <em>de</em> (Carla Rodrigos eta Carlas de Ramires).</p>
