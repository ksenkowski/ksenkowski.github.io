<h4>Navari</h4>
<p class="first">The Navari made their appearance on the world stage dramatically on 8 Lugor 476 3E when a Navari fleet destroyed an imperial garrison on the island of Lidnikos. The devastation of that key island shocked and alerted the Empire that no place was safe from these warriors from the frozen north. More than any other single event, this attack demonized the Navari in the eyes of the people of the Empire, shaping their interactions to this day, over 400 years later.</p>
<p>The Navari see themselves as the descendants of the three brothers who overthrew the Jutun in the First Age and became the Cold Gods; Vajir, Vojin, and Vijir. Each of these gods embody the three virtues that the Navari hold dear to this day; self-sacrifice, persistence, and deception. Combined with a belief that the destiny of everyone is set by the three Fates, has molded their society around the idea that any day can be your last, so seek glory at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>Navari names focus on first names coupled with colorful descriptors. Surnames, both Patronymic and Matronymic are used, but due to changeable nature and a lack of inheritence of surnames over generations, they are less useful than the descriptors. Patronymic surnames terminate with a <em>-sen</em> suffix and Matronymic surnames terminate with a <em>-sena</em> suffix (Britor "The Golden" Dalmarsen or Oda "Blood Eyes" Sifsena).</p>

While their belief in how one achieves heaven has changed over time to include those who serve any of the Twenty Four, violence against enemies is still viewed as the ideal path.

<h6>Those Who Serve</h6>
<p class="first">In many ways, Navari society is built upon the back of thralls. Thralls are typically individuals who are captured in battle but unable to be ransomed. Whatever their life was before, they are broken and forced work as servants, farmers and laborers for their masters.</p>
