<h4>Hellas</h4>
<p class="first">In Hellas legend, Helios led the first of his people to Hellas Peninsula after the fall of the Jutun kingdom of Gigir. There they established the great cities of Ennea, Lofos, and Gatos. In time the city-states of the Hellas eventually spreading across to Sana Minor and the Matilado Sea, building colonies and battling for supremacy with the peoples of the south. The apex of their expansion came under Arkos of Narus, who spread Hellas culture as far south as the River Santu through conquest. Though his empire did not last after his death, the influence of the Hellas culture does to this day in all the lands their feet have touched.</p>
<p>The Hellas were among the first people to be conquered by the Empire, but in contrast to the Empire's other conquests, the Hellas culture was elevated to stand just below the imperial Vorish culture. Every noble had a Hellas tutor for his children, Hellas sailors dominated the Imperial Navy, and Hellas became the language of the Orthodox Church. Ironically, these roles have since reversed in the Empire, with those of Hellas descent dominating the Empire establishing Hellene as the language of the court and Vorish as the language of the Church.</p>
<p>Today those who consider themselves Hellas come from lands both in the Empire and far to the south in the Kalifate and beyond. Their physical characteristics may vary dramatically, but they are all bound by a common language, a common reverence for education, and a respect for the power of the sea.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The naming practices of the Hellas has not changed since the most ancient of days. Even the overwhelming influence of Vorish culture on these people has not forced them to change the ways in which they identify one another. The Hellas are given a single name at birth along with a patronymic (father or family progenitor given name) terminated with the suffix <em>-ides</em>.

<h6>The Evgeni</h6>
<p class="first">In many ways, the Empire is split in two, between the Vorish territories in the west and the Hellas territories in the east. In the eastern half of the Empire, a small number Evengi rule a vast number of people with virtually no representation in the state. From their number come the Emperadors, Patriarchas and the great ministers of the Empire.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li><strong>Arkontis</strong><br/><small>The Arkontis are the core of the Hellas nobility, owning vast tracts of land in the eastern half of the Empire. Raised in the arts of war, philosophy, and theology, they serve the Emperador in the Gerosa, a body that suggest laws for ratification.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>

	</ul>
<h6>The Doulosi</h6>
<p class="first">The Hellas incarnation of the Orthodox Church has a distinct flavor drawn from the culture's long past of supporting muliple schools of philosophy. At times this has put the Emperador in Cidiero and the Patriarch at odds leading to the occasional theological crisis. Like the Vors, the Hellas deny the Last Prophet and raise up the trinity of Vajir, Vojin and Vijir above the rest of the Twenty Four. However, due to the their more mystical approach to religion, they are more tolerant of variance in the canon.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li><strong>Nikokrati</strong><br/><small>The Hellas have a long tradition of formal schools that teach theology, philosophy, healing and the manipulation of the Wyrd. The Nikokrati gain their training in a formalized setting centered on different philosphical schools, such as the Stoic School and the Epicurean School.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>
	<li><strong>Anakriti</strong><br/><small>The Anakriti make up the backbone of the Orthodox Church in the east. They serve as conduits to the Twenty Four, as political advisors, as educators, and as soldiers. They simultanesouly live both within society and outside of it as they ultimately answer to the Emperador and no one else.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>
	<li><strong>Kalogeros</strong><br/><small>High on blessed Mount Oros, the Kalogeros train themselves in religious asceticism. Through depravation of the body, they strengthen the spirit and become living wards against Taint.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>
</ul>
<h6>The Stratiogi</h6>
<p class="first">Just as in the western half of the Empire, the Stratiogi are a unifying force. There, men and women of any class can try to make their fortune and start a new life. Cultural and social differences fall away when faced with twenty years of service fighting against threats both within the borders of the Empire and without.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li><strong>Fantaros</strong><br/><small>Unlike most other cultures, the Empire has a long tradition of professional soldiers. Joining the military is the only manner in which a commoner change their station in life.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>		
		<li><strong>Kapetios</strong><br/><small>While not all officers come from noble families, the ranks of the Kapetios are predominantely filled with younger sons and daughters looking to make a name for themself.

		<li><strong>Thalassia</strong><br/><small>No Imperial soldier is as valued and admired as the Thalassia. Working in concert with the Vauntis, they are the shock troops that force marine landings and are often the deciding factor in naval engagements.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>		
		<li><strong>Vauntis</strong><br/><small>The Hellas have been long famed for their ability to make war at sea. It is said that Telesikos would never have conquered the south in the Second Age if not for the great navy he constructed.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>		
	</ul>
<h6>The Astosi</h6>
<p class="first">The vast majority of the population in the eastern half of the Empire comes from the Astosi though rarely do they stay in the profession of their parents. Hellas culture has long been a meritocracy, allowing for even the most lowly laborer the opportunity to prove themself and raise their station.</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
	<li><strong>Agrotis</strong><br/><small>The Empire is perhaps best known for two products, olives and grapes. However, the aldeao cultivate a wide variety of crops and maintain herds of goats, cows and pigs.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>

	<li><strong>Naftis</strong><br/><small>The Empire is a country long tied to the seas. The Marujo are perhaps not as famous for their handling of ships like Hellas Naftis, but they have dominated the Mae Mar for centuries.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +1</small></li>
	<li><strong>Emporos</strong><br/><small>Merkadoros are the connective tissue of society, tying cultures separated by vast distances together through trade.

	<li><strong>Nafpigos</strong><br/><small>Unlike most of her neighbors, the Empire has developed schools to train men and women in the arts of healing. This is no wyrding they practice, but science mixed with superstision.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>
