<h4>Zehar</h4>
<p class="first">The Zehar are a people that seem to predate history. All known records account for them living in the mountains north of the Great City, never knowing the conqueror's boot, but joining first the Hellas expansion under Arkos of Narus then later the Empire as it extended it's borders. Followers of the Great Cycle, they are seemingly uncaring of world politics.</p>
<p>While many other cultures follow some form of the Great Cycle in which a finite number of souls reincarnate eternally, the Zehar take this belief to an extreme. They believe they live the same life over and over again. The place and people may change over time, but the story of their lives remains constant.</p>
<p>When a Zehar reaches a certain point in their life, it is said they have reached the Moment of Knowing. It is at this time they realize the path their life must take, be it glorious, infamous, or mundane. From then on they work to live out their story, which is part of the Ballad of the Great Cycle.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The Zehar use a purely descriptive surname that they don't take on until their Moment of Knowing. This means most Zehar simply go by their first name, with perhaps a general descriptor, such as Ayfem the baker of Eethel. However, when they have their moment of knowing, they take on the famed descriptor of their soul regardless of it's reflection of their physical nature (Ahlahr the Small, Sayvah the Vor Slayer, etc).</p>

<h6>Ottiti atto Auttin</h6>
<p class="first">Not all tales in the Ballad of the Great Cycle require wars, violence and base trickery to entertain God.

Those whom the song has moved to these professions are of the Ottiti atto Auttin</p>
	<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li><strong>Iatphos</strong><br><small>Those who heal physical wounds, rends in the soul, and bring peace among those who war are called the Iatphos.

		<li><strong>Kavutis</strong><br><small>There is something special in the making and crafting of things and the Ballad of the Great Cycle is interwoven with this beauty. Those who make the focus of their tale creation, be it a beautiful song or a mighty sword, are called Kavutis<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>
		<li><strong>Knittouphos</strong><br><small>No tale could exist without those who cultivate the land and the beasts that dwell on it. Without the Knittouphos no warrior tale would include beer drinking and no leader's tale would be born on horseback.<br/><strong>Influence Recovery:</strong> +2</small></li>
