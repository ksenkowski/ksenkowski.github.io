		<h3>The Network</h3>
		<p class="first">Each character in the game has their own Network of contacts, friends, and enemies they can utilize to aid them in their journey. Some may be aware of the quest and others ignorant, but all have a reason to work with that character.</p>
		<p>Each character's Network consists of an Inner Circle and an Outer Circle. The Inner Circle holds a maximum of three individuals that are protected from the actions of the GM's Archetypes. The Outer Circle holds a maximum of seven individuals that are not protected from the GM. A character can move individuals between these two Circles before the start of any scene so long as their is space. They may also be narrated into a scene by the player so long as it is contextually relevant.</p>
