			<h3>The Cell and the Conspiracy</h3>
			<p class="first">The struggle between the Conspiracy and pockets of men and women making a stand against unfathomable evil is seemingly as old as time. No one knows what the Conspiracy truly is, nor are their aims fully understood outside bringing ruin to humanity.</p>
			<p>The struggle began on the streets of the Great City, Cidiero. From her sweat soaked back alleys to the court of the Emperador himself, the Cell has worked to unravel the Conspiracy's hold on everything. The war has now escalated and the Conspiracy no longer sees it as a diverting game. The Cell has learned too much, and half fleeing now makes it's way to the Mountain, to conclude the war one way or another.</p>
