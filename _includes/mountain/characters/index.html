			<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
			<p class="first"><em>The Mountain</em> is intended for three to six players who will play out the confrontation between the Cell and the Conspiracy. Prior to play beginning, one player takes on the role of the Game Master and the other players take on the role of a Cell member.</p>
			<p>Taking the role of a Cell member is similar to playing a character for any number of role playing games. You first select one of the five archetypes, select one of the pregenerated characters and flesh that character out by drawing on the Character Details Table. With all of that done, it is your responsibility to take that framework and bring it to life through play. You frame the character's actions, meet challenges, and play to the character's motivations.</p>
			<p>The Game Master has the more daunting task of pacing the game, framing scenes, and providing much of the color of the world the characters are journeying through in <em>The Mountain</em>. In this way it is much like the role of a GM in other role playing games only with a specific structure and archetypes to work with.</p>
			<p>At the start of play, each player selects a role and an archetype. They then place the Cell token on the map at the Great City of Cidiero. The Game Master constructs the first arc and creates the various adversaries and potential allies that will make their apperance there.</p>
