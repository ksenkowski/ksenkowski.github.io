			<h3>Assign Your Traits</h3>
			<p class="first">Traits are what define the capabilities of characters in the game. Each trait has a number associated with it to indicate the base number of dice rolled in a Challenge. If anything you characters wish to try does not fall under one of the traits, the GM chooses the closest approximation.</p>
			<p>When assigning Traits, you assigning numbers following the pattern of 6/5/4/4/3/3/2. With these numbers in place you can derive your Vitality, Influence and Willpower Pools. When putting together your Pools, make sure to account for any bonuses based on your Talent choices.</p>
