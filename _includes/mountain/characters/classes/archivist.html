		<h4 id="archivist">The Archivist</h4>
		<p class="first">An Archivist is one who searches out esoteric sources of divine lore to safeguard the world against the Tainted. They work, often as an apprentice first, but later on their own to develop techniques to ward off and destroy that evil. No ritual or Wyrding is too dangerous in their mind to try and understand.</p>
		<p>In some parts of the world, Archivists are members of large organizations dedicated to destroying the Taint. In other places they are lonely individuals who once delved too deeply and now cannot give up the fight. It is also whispered there are those who use their knowledge for personal gain, embracing the Taint to achieve power.</p>
		<h5>Talents</h5>
		<p class="first">The Archivist spend the majority of their life delving into forbidden knowledge in an attempt to discover ways to change the world. The following list of Talents reflect their desire to stop the steady darkening of the world.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">

			<li>Dark Secret<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Dark Mastery <br/>Some Tainted enemies require more study than others. Choose a specific Tainted enemy the character has encountered before. When the character speaks this secret in that enemy's presence, it gives that enemy a number of Disadvantages equal to the character's current number of Doom Dice. This ability may only be used once per Arc.</small></li>
			<li>Dark Tactics<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Dark Knowledge <br/>Understanding the powers of the Tainted is only the first step in combatting them. With enough practice, and Archivist becomes a wise tactician, understanding how to destroy the enemy. If the Archivist is the leader in a Skirmish, they grant a cumulative +1R to their allies for each time they have faced this kind of Tainted foe.</small></li>
			<li>Foreknowledge<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>Understanding the Taint means that the Archivist must also come to understand prophecy. Once per Turn, after an ally uses a Doom Die, you may steal it from the GM to use as you wish.</small></li>
			<li>Mind Fog<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Arcane Familiar<br/>Speaking with the untainted spirits in the world puts the Archivist in the unique position to request their aid. You can spend 3 Willpower to give one opponent a -1R to their very next toss.</small> </li>

			<li>Still Mind<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/> Studying the Tainted exposes an Archivist to some of the worst humanity and the supernatural has to offer. This requires discipline to not go mad. You get a +1R to all Challenges where you might be horrified or terrified.</small></li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Cultural Synergies</h5>
		<p class="first">Archivists have long walked the land in search of answers to the Taint that stains the world. In the Second Age, when humanity first began to lay down the foundations of civilization, Archivists banded together into philosophical schools.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
			<li>Court of the Emperador<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Vor Culture<br/>The Imperial School was founded in the days of the Great Republic as both a place of general learning and to train Archivists to serve the state. With the advent of the Empire, they continued their role, working to bring order where the Taint sowed chaos. You gain a +1s when attempting the Purification Ritual.</small></li>
			<li>Sees the Song<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Hellas or Zeher Culture<br/>In the mountains west of Brot, the School of the Endless Song has long trained Archivists to combat the Taint. They believe that reality is one endless song and if you can understand the notes, you can make great changes to the world. Once per Turn you may ask the GM a question regarding what is ahead of your character and they must answer truthfully (e.g. What is in the next room? When will the next attack come?).</small></li>
