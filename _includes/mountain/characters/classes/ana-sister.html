		<h4 id="ana-sister">Ana Sister</h4>
		<p class="first">The Ana Sisterhood is a key social, religious, and political force in the Kalifate. They train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to achieve human perfection. The end result is a society of women who are one part trusted advisor, one part skilled diplomat and one part willing assassin.</p>
		<p>Ana Sisters are highly prized by the great noble houses, both in the Kalifate and the Empire. Many sisters come from these same houses, creating a triple alliance through marriage between two noble houses and the Sisterhood itself.</p>

		<h5>Cultural Synergies</h5>
		<p class="first">The Ana Sisterhood was born out of the harsh and fluid social environment of the formation of the Kalifate. Before the Prophet gave birth to the son of Vojin, whom reshaped the people, there were dozens of smaller Sisterhoods in the Great Waste, all training in their own peculiar way. This as made the following Talents available for Ana Sisters of Malin descent.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
			<li>School of the Lion<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Malin Culture<br/>The School of the Lion was located in the mountains north of the Great Waste before the God-King merged all the schools. There they mastered a technique for making their voice heard over great distances. You may project your voice up to a distance of 5 miles away. You may also choose to pitch in such a way that it can cause terror in others. This initiates a Temperament Challenge that if successful those that hear it suffer as if they faced the Feared Advantage.</small></li>
			<li>School of the Falcon<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Malin Culture<br/>The School of the Falcon was favored by the royal tribes of the old Malin desert kingdoms. The school taught a technique for focusing one's vision to be able to see the smallest detail up to a mile away. You gain a +1R to any vision-based Challenges and are impossible to surprise in the open steppe or desert.</small></li>
			<li>School of the Fox<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Malin Culture<br/>The School of the Fox was popular among the lesser tribes in the old Malin Kingdoms.

You may also get a free move to separate from an enemy before they attack by making an opposed Athletics Challenge.</small></li>
