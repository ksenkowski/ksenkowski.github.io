		<h4>Caravan Master</h4>
		<p class="first">Caravan Masters are the connective tissue of society, tying cultures separated by vast distances together. The lands they traverse are harsh and unforgiving, plagued by bandits and the miscommunication born of cultural differences. The very best Caravan Masters are master communicators with pretanatural senses for danger and deals.</p>
		<p>Caravan Masters are leaders and master merchants, adaptable to vastly different cultural situations. They come from all walks of life, but all value finding solutions with the right words and a greased palm over bring to bear fire and steel.</p>
