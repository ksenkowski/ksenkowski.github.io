<h6>Hellas</h6>
<p class="first">In Hellas legend, Helios led the first of his people to Hellas Peninsula after the fall of the Jutun kingdom of Gigir. There they established the great cities of Kaptos, Palidos, and Alvrados (modern Captar, Palido, and Alvrado). In time the city-states of the Hellas eventually spreading across to Sana Minor and the Mineos Sea, building colonies and battling for supremacy with the peoples of the south. The apex of their expansion came under Arkos of Mapakos, who spread Hellas culture as far south as the River Sokooto through conquest. Though his empire did not last after his death, the influence of the Hellas culture does to this day in all the lands their feet have touched.</p>
<p>The Hellas were among the first people to be conquered by the Empire, but in contrast to the Empire's other conquests, the Hellas culture was elevated to stand just below the imperial Vorish culture. Every noble had a Hellas tutor for his children, Hellas sailors dominated the Imperial Navy, and Hellas became the language of the Orthodox Church. Ironically, these roles have since reversed in the Empire, with those of Hellas descent dominating the Empire establishing Hellene as the language of the court and Vorish as the language of the Church.</p>
<p>Today those who consider themselves Hellenes come from lands both in the Empire and far to the south in the Kalifate and beyond. Their physical characteristics may vary dramatically, but they are all bound by a common language, a common reverence for education, and a respect for the power of the sea.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The naming practices of the Hellas has not changed since the most ancient of days. Even the overwhelming influence of Vorish culture on these people has not forced them to change the ways in which they identify one another. The Hellas are given a single name at birth along with a patronymic (father or family progenitor given name) terminated with the suffix <em>-ides</em>. Choose your character's name and their surname (Amvelos Leoviskosides).</p>

		<li><strong>Well Connected</strong><br><small>The Hellans as a people, tend to feel everyone's business is their business. While this can lead to nosey neighbors, it also means a Hellan is rarely in any neighborhood or region without knowing at least one person.<br><em>You may name one person they know when entering a named location on the map. They may add that character to your Network if you have space on your sheet.</em></small></li>
