<h6>Rankians</h6>
<p class="first">Throughout most of the 2nd Age, the Rankians dominated what is now Santuvessa. There they held sway over the wide variety of tribes that made the Holy Jungle their home. While their subjugation of these peoples was not overtly harsh, it did force these cultures into positions of subservience with no hope of changing their station.</p>
<p>Then came Gampo, a shaman and chieftain of the Onike people. He united the many clans of the Onike as well as secured the loyalty of the Fetash, a strange, pale skinned people who migrated west from the Kingdoms of Ivory. With the macabre rituals of the Fetash supporting his Onike warriors, they proceeded to annihilate the Rankian people, man woman and child. In the end only Atrahasis, the Holy Refuge, was left standing.</p>
<p>The few survivors took to caravans and boarded ships, heading north and west across the Desabitado Arido to escape the holocaust. They spread throughout the Empire and the pre-Kalifate kingdoms, carving out a niche for themselves in society's underbelly. There they flourish, taking advantage of the weakness of others and slowly gaining respectability.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>Rankian first names reflect the mythic 21 founders of the Rankian people and their wives. They have no other names and for this reason their surnames are complex and varied in their construction. The typical format of their surname is a conjunction of their tribal name (Atha, Blak, Bok, Bran, Der, Dan, Fan, Frek, Jaco, Kir, Mar, Mor and Sker), place of birth, and occupation (Lorita Der'Paci Drova).</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Language</strong><br/>Rankians natively speak Ranka, a somewhat common tongue. Because of this they also have a passing understanding of the other Duni languages, Hazan, Hanud, and Ayun.</p>
