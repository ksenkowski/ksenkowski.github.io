<h6>Malins</h6>
<p class="first">Malin legend holds that they, as a people, were originally from a land they called Paleki. There they were a soft people living in a soft land of milk an honey. A people used to Paradise on earth, having avoided the machinations of the Jutun, the First Men, or even the Ilan Adam, who legend have lived on the edges of Paradise.</p>
<p>This tranquility changed with the great flooding caused by the melting ice that heralded the end of the Jutun. This flooding washed the wards away from the Cin-Seytan Gate, allowing the Jinn to escape their infernal prison. They invaded paradise, harvesting the Malins, transplanting them to the Great Waste, weeding out the weak and shaping Malin society.</p>
<p>When the Last Prophet (293 3E) came out of the most desolate parts of the wastes to unite the Malin Oymaqs (extended families) against their Jinn overlords, the Malins began to take on the shape they hold today. Over 600 years later, the Malins are still a hard  people who adhere to traditions that blend the merciless violence of their time under the Jinn with the religious zeal of the followers of the Last Prophet and the opulence of their neighbor and rival, the Empire.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The naming practices of the Malins is deeply tied to their transplantation to the Great Waste. First names are granted at age 15, reflecting some aspect of their personality. Surnames reflect a conjunction (<em>-ib-</em>) of the father's first name, the name of origin of the individual's Oymaq, and the individual's grandmother (Panah Negar-ib-Deylaq-ib-Inara).</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Language</strong><br/>The Malins natively speak Ayun, one of the most common languages in the world. Because of this they also have a passing understanding of the other Duni languages, Hazan, Hanud, and Ranka.</p>

		<li><strong>The Open Eye</strong><br><small>When surviving in the Great Waste, all members of an Oymaq must have value. It is for this reason the Jinn Ramallo opened the mind's eye of the people, allowing them to channel their inner strength for any challenge.<br><em>You may substitute Willpower for any Challenge at a 1:1 ratio.</em></small></li>

		<li><strong>Discipline of the Wastes</strong><br><small>The Malins have found that the only way to truly survive in the most inhospitable conditions is to maintain a rigid discipline. From a young age, Malin children are trained to obey the myriad of military, cultural and religious codes of conduct that structure their lives. <br><em>You gain a +1D when following the orders of a social, military or religious superior.</em></small></li>
