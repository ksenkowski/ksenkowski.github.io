<h6>Navari</h6>
<p class="first">The Navari made their appearance on the world stage dramatically on 8 Lugor 476 3E when the Navari destroyed an imperial garrison on the island of Lidnikos. The devastation of that key island shocked and alerted the lords of the West that no place was safe from this warriors from the frozen north. More than any other single event, this attack demonized the Navari in the eyes of the people of the West, shaping their interactions to this day, over 400 years later.</p>
<p>The Navari see themselves as the descendants of the three brothers who overthrew the Jutun in the First Age and became the Cold Gods; Vajir, Vojin, and Vijir. Each of these gods embody the three virtues that the Navari hold dear to this day; self-sacrifice, persistence, and deception. Combined with a belief that the destiny of everyone is set by the three Fates has molded their society around the idea that any day can be your last, so seek glory at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>Navari names focus on first names coupled with colorful descriptors. Surnames, both Patronymic and Matronymic are used, but due to changeable nature due to a lack of inheritence of surnames over generations, they are less useful than the descriptors. Patronymic surnames terminate with a <em>-sen</em> suffix and Matronymic surnames terminate with a <em>-sena</em> suffix (Britor "The Golden" Dalmarsen or Oda "Blood Eyes" Sifsena).</p>

		<li><strong>Resigned to Fate</strong><br><small>The Navari religion has long been centered fatalism, as each believes that their fate has been pre-determined by the gods. Even those who have converted to the Orthodox Church share this view, which they find liberating, living their lives as if it may end tomorrow.<br><em>The character earns 1 Doom when they face down death in a Skirmish and do not break or flee.</em></small></li>

The GM must then tell you one unknown detail about it/them.</em></small></li>
