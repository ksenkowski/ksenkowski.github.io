		<h3>Playing the Game</h3>
		<p class="first"><em>The Mountain</em> is like most table-top role-playing games. Where it is different is how it demarcates time. Gameplay is broken into Scenes, Turns, and Arcs.</p>
		<p> Scenes are the narration and role-playing portion of play. They can be centered on color, challenges or Skirmishes. Color scenes where no Challenges or Skirmishes take place but information is exchanged. Challenge scenes are where players roll to overcome obstacles in an attempt to achieve a single goal (e.g. infiltrate the castle, track the villain to their lair). Skirmish scenes are where a fight breaks out and the Skirmish rules are used.</p>
		<p>Turns are a collection of scenes centered on a single idea or goal. New Turns begin when the focus of the scenes change. For example, if the Cell was infiltrating the castle to plant evidence on the lord for heresy and then shifted gears to follow the high priest to a clandestine meeting as he left the castle, that would be the start of a new turn. The Game Master decides when a Turn ends and informs the players.</p>
		<p>Arcs are a collection of Turns that take place at a single location. They begin when the Cell arrives and end when the Cell begins the next leg of their journey.</p>
		
		<h4>Advancement</h4>
		<p class="first">Every time a character engages in a Challenge, roll D666 and add the Difficulty of all the Challenges the character has engaged in since the last time they advanced. If you roll 666 or higher, the character advances. You may select a new Talent from the Talent list in which you meet it's requirements.</p>
		<h4>Character Death</h4>
		<p class="first">When a character is killed in play, that is not the end of the game for that player. The Archetype lives on to continue the quest to the Mountain and the ultimate confrontation with the Cult of the Unseen. As a player you have two choices. You can either apply the Archetype to a member of your deceased character's Network or you can apply the Archetype to a member of one of the other player's Network. In doing so you generate a character as normal if the character hasn't already been fleshed out with a class and background.</p>
