<h4>The Archivist</h4>
<p class="first">An Archivist is one who searches out esoteric sources of divine lore to safeguard the world against the Tainted. They work, often as an apprentice first, but later on their own to develop techniques to ward off and destroy that evil. No ritual or Wyrding is too dangerous in their mind to try and understand.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, Archivists are members of large organizations dedicated to destroying the Taint. In other places they are lonely individuals who once delved too deeply and now cannot give up the fight. It is also whispered there are those who use their knowledge for personal gain, embracing the Taint to achieve power.</p>
