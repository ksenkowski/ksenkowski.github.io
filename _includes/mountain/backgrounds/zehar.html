<h6>Zehar</h6>
<p class="first">The Zehar are a people that seem to predate human history. All known records account for them living in the mountains north of the Great City, never knowing the conqueror's boot, but joining first the Hellene expansion under Arkos of Mapakos then later the Empire as it extended it's borders. They are seemingly uncaring of world politics as they are, as a people, followers of the Great Cycle.</p>
<p>While many other cultures follow some form of the Great Cycle in which a finite number of souls reincarnate eternally, the Zehar take this belief to an extreme. They believe they live the same life over and over again. The place and people may change over time, but the story of their lives remains constant.</p>
<p>When a Zehar reaches a certain point in their life, it is said they have reached the moment of knowing. It is at this time they realize the path their life must take, be it glorious, infamous, or mundane.. From then on they work to live out their story, which is part of the Ballad of the Great Cycle.</p>
<p class="first"><strong>Names</strong><br/>The Zehar use a purely descriptive surname that they don't take on until their moment of knowing. This means most Zehar simply go by their first name, with perhaps a general descriptor, such as Ayfem the baker of Eethel. However, when they have their moment of knowing, they take on the famed descriptor of their soul regardless of it's reflection of their physical nature (Ahlahr the Small, Sayvah the Vor Slayer, etc).</p>
