		<h4>Purification Rituals</h4>
		<p class="first">Purification Rituals allow a character to send a spirit, demon or animated corpse back to where it came, remove Taint from an individual, destroy a Taint Sinkhole and undo the effects of a Domination Ritual. The Difficulty of the Wyrding Challenge of this Ritual is equal to the target's Taint Trait. When used in a Skirmish it takes a number of Rounds equal to the Difficulty.</p>
		<p>A successful Wyrding Challenge creates the desired effect of the ritual. Failure always results in a Twist or Condition determined by the GM.</p>
