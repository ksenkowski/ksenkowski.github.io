		<h4>Dominance Ritual</h4>
		<p class="first">The Dominance Ritual allows a character to take control of a Taint Sinkhole or an individual. The Difficulty of this Ritual's Wyrding Challenge is equal to the Sinkhole's Strength or the target's Temperament roll.</p>
		<p>Success puts the Power of the Sinkhole at the character's disposal or forces the individual to follow your every command until a Purification Ritual is successfully used on the individual or they are killed.  When used in a Skirmish it takes a number of Rounds equal to the Difficulty. Failure always results in a Twist or Condition dtermined by the GM.</p>
