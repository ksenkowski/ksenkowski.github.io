		<h4>Consequences of Failure</h4>
		<p class="first">Harm is the most basic of consequences of a failed Wyrd. The Wyrd is successful, but the GM assigns a Harm tied to the spell with a duration equal to the duration of the Wyrd. Wyrds with an Instant duration cause Harm that lasts a Scene. See the Harm section for some examples to use as a guide.</p>
		<p>Reversal of Fortune can be disastrous for a user of the Wyrd. Instead of the intended effect, the opposite occurs. A Hinder on an enemy warrior might become a Help. A Harm used on a crowd might strike the character's allies instead. The GM gets to decide how it all shakes out.</p>
		<p>The Wyrd is not the domain of humanity, but of creatures alien and often terrible. Something from the other side has marked the character for special interest. The GM creates a new Horror that they may now introduce to the game. They may decide if the Horror is an outsider or a part of the Court of Shadows.</p>
