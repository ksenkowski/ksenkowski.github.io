		<h3>Building an Arc</h3>
		<p class="first">Arcs are both a series of events that occur at a single location on the journey map as well as the central idea being explored. Each Arc begins with a concept to function as a framework. It guides the GM in the creation process and should be expressed as an opposing idea (e.g. Loyalty vs Faith), a simple statement (e.g. Retribution), or a question (e.g. What is the cost of revealing the truth?). Some appropriate concepts are:</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
			<li><strong>Betrayal</strong><br/>Betrayal can play a key role in the game. It is based upon the idea that anyone can be a villain. Anyone can step over the line and expose comrades to risk, even death. Betrayal can appear in a symbolic fashion or as a tragic character flaw in one of the characters or supporting cast members. However, this can be easily overused. Don’t use betrayal commonly in the forefront of every arc.</li>
			<li><strong>Corruption</strong><br/>The slow, spiraling descent from the light into the pit of evil is a core aspect of the game. It is easy to introduce symbolism in an arc with scenes of decaying flesh, rotting wood, and other common horror trappings. Or, corruption can appear as the eroding morality of a protagonist or key supporting cast member in the face of evil. The most obvious use of this mission concept is when the Cell must defend a corrupt world from an even worse alternative.</li>
			<li><strong>Doom</strong><br/>Doom is a difficult concept to use in a game because it is an end result instead of an ongoing struggle. It is the ultimate destiny of corruption. Doom can hang over the characters, antagonists, supporting cast members, or the world at large. It can also appear as a part of a prophecy, or in the ruins of the ancient empires throughout parts of the world. Regardless of the way the GM uses Doom, it works best when balanced against other themes.</li>
			<li><strong>Struggle</strong><br/>Struggle is a key concept for all <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> games. Fighting a powerful conspiracy hinges on the idea of a struggle. It is rooted in both the internal struggles of characters as well as their external struggles. The GM can represent this concept in black-and-white, such as "good versus evil." It can also be used effectively with complex issues like, "Do the ends justify the means?" and "How do you defeat violence with violence?"</li>
			<li><strong>Faith</strong><br/>The setting of <em>The Mountain</em> is built upon faith. Religion is not simply a series of beliefs, but a solid way of life to people in the world. However, the mission concept of Faith also covers an individual’s belief in themself and their allies. This makes it an excellent concept to use. Test characters’ faiths at every opportunity. The characters should see and hear things that shake their faith to its foundation. When these tests are subtle, they are more effective.</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>Arcs are typically constructed of a combination of four obstacles to overcome; locations, conspirators, monsters, and people. Mixing and matching these four things is the formula for creating a compelling arc.</p>
		<ul class="unstyled spaced-list">
			<li><strong>Locations</strong><br/>Locations come in two types, the mundane and Sinkholes. Mundane locations are the common geography that stand in the way of their goals, be they festering sewers in a bustling city or the ice shrouded keep of the local lord. Sinkholes are the haunted and horrible location where the supernatural world leaks into the mundane world. Both can be effective at bringing the arc to life as obstacles.</li>
			<li><strong>Conspirators</strong><br/>The Cult of the Unseen is ever working against the Cell to thwart their quest to the Mountain. However not every Arc has to be about struggling against the conspiracy's machinations. They work best as an obstacle when used as major milestones on the Cell's journey.</li>
			<li><strong>Monsters</strong><br/>The world of <em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em> is rich with monsters living just on the edge of the civilized world. Some work directly with the Cult and other work towards their own goals, but all help to ratchet up the unnerving atmosphere of the game.</li>
			<li><strong>People</strong><br/>People not aligned with the struggle of the Cell can make interesting obstacles and their motivations don't always have to be sinister. The tax collector that blocks their caravan from leaving can be just as compelling as the witch trying to destroy them with her undead horde.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Arcs typically follow one of three sets of Turn structures; the Gauntlet, the Quest, and the Confrontation. Deciding upon one will go a long way in helping the Game Master both prepare the right obstacles as well as guide both the atomosphere and the pace of play.</p>
		<h4>The Gauntlet</h4>
		<p class="first">The Gauntlet always begins with the Cell in some peril from which they must escape. The focus of the Arc is the characters themselves and their actions, not on the antagonists trying to harm them. This is a very common structure in a Conspiracy of Shadows game, as the Cell often finds itself in trouble either as a consequence of player choices or by the actions of the Cult of the Unseen.</p>
		<p>Gauntlet Arcs work best with a pendulum style of pacing. The Arc starts in a tense series of moments with the Cell in a crisis from which they must escape without much time to think, only to act. After that moment of crisis, the pace slows a bit, allowing the Cell characters to rest and collect their breath. Then, the pace again picks up towards the ultimate end of the mission as they try to overcome the danger.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Escape from a city under siege.</li>
			<li>Escort an ally to safety.</li>
			<li>Kidnap a member of the Cult.</li>
			<li>Break into or out of a prison.</li>
			<li>Fight a running battle on the road.</li>
			<li>Escort refugees through a warzone.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Quest</h4>
		<p class="first">The Quest structure centers on the Cell moving through a series of horrifying places in order to obtain something of value. It is very much influenced by the literary hero story arc in which the hero travels through the metaphorical wasteland to reach his ultimate goal. In this type of session, the focus is on the journey of the Cell and its interaction with the terrifying locations and horrific situations encountered. It is effectively the larger game but on a smaller scale.</p>
		<p>Quest Arcs work best as a gradual rise towards a crisis point, which can be at the end of a mission. Or, the GM can pull the rug out from under the Cell earlier as a surprise. The Arc starts off quietly, with plenty of time for planning and preparation by the Cell. As the Arc progresses, things slowly pick up as the GM throws increasingly difficult challenges at them, eventually leading to a crisis point at the end.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Find the corpse of the liche king.</li>
			<li>Destroy an unholy instrument.</li>
			<li>Rescue an important noble from bondage.</li>
			<li>Recover a lost weapon from a ruined city.</li>
			<li>Bring aid from a neighboring kingdome.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Confrontation</h4>
		<p class="first">In a Confrontation Arc a villain directly opposes the Cell. The focus is upon the relationship between this nemesis and the Cell. Typically these Arcs only make their appearance at important milestones in the greater journey. Confrontation Arcs work best with a pendulum style of pacing.</p>
		<p>The Arc starts with a confrontation with the nemesis or their agents, but with no time for Cell to plan, only to react. After the confrontation, the Cell gets a chance to be proactive, setting the stage for the next confrontation, where the nemesis is forced to react to the Cell.</p>
		<ul class="spaced-list">
			<li>Compete for the favor of the ruler.</li>
			<li>Thwart the nemesis' illegal activities.</li>
			<li>Discover the nemesis' secret.</li>
			<li>Destroy the nemesis' most valuable asset.</li>
			<li>Force the nemesis to sign a treaty.</li>
			<li>Destroy the nemesis.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Creating Locations</h3>
		<p class="first">Locations are an interesting dynamic and a map that fits on a single piece of paper (letter format or A4). It can be a city, a neighborhood a building, an unexplored tomb or any other place you can imagine. The important thing is to utilize the constraints a single piece of paper provides.</p>
