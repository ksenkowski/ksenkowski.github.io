		<h3>Character Death</h3>
		<p class="first">When a character is killed in play, that is not the end of the game for that player. The Archetype lives on to continue the quest to the Mountain and the ultimate confrontation with the Conspiracy. As a player you have two choices. You can either apply the Archetype to a member of your deceased character's Network or you can apply the Archetype to a member of one of the other player's Network. In doing so you generate a character as per the Adversary rules if the character hasn't already been fleshed out.</p>
