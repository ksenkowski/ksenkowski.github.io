		<h3>Your First Game</h3>
		<p class="first">When starting <em>The Mountain</em>, the game always begins <em>in media res</em> with the characters fleeing enemies in The Great City towards the Mountain. The Great City could be any of the major cities on the map. Personally I prefer Cidiero or Al'Duniyun as my starting point with some sort of enemy in hot pursuit.</p>
