		<h3>Loot</h3>
		<p class="first">In The Mountain, Loot is the genearic term used to describe anything of value that characters can get out of a Challenge or Skirmish. It isn't just tangible objects like gear or artifacts, but can easily be knowlege about the Cell's enemies, having the powerful owe you a favor, or even a new ally.</p>
		<p>Typically, Loot is something planned by the GM as the reward or Twist the character's receive at the end of an encounter. However, it can be just as fun to embrace a random dice roll on the Loot tables to see where the game takes you. When doing so, roll on the  Loot Type Table then use that result to roll on the appropriate follow up table.</p>
