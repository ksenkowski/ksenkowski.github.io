		<h3>Taint</h3>
		<p class="first">Taint is the potential corruption of a character brought on by following their dark impulses and through encounters with the supernatural. This corruption is both a descent into evil and the progressive loss of a character's humanity. The corruption infuses the character and slowly removes what makes them human.</p>
		<p>Whenever a character takes an action that puts their humanity in jeopardy consult the Taint Modifier table. Toss 24 rune stones and add the modifier to your total number of successes. If the result is 666 or greater, the character then draws against the Taint Effects Table.</p>

		<h4>Becoming Tainted</h4>
		<p class="first">When a character first becomes Tainted, they gain an aura. It is a subtle hint of the otherworldly power that has begun to infuse the character. Add to your character sheet what this subtle aura is. It could be a constant rustling of wind that surrounds the character, a particular odor, or any other colorful effect.</p>
		<p>After this initial effect, any additional Taint requires the player to draw against the Taint Effects Table. You may also select an option if you wish to maintain a theme for your character. Update your character sheet with the following details:</p>
