		<h3>The Character Sheet</h3>
		<p class="first">To play <em>The Mountain</em>, you need to keep a written record of your character. When filling it out, make sure to use a pencil as during play the character will constantly be changing. It is also useful to have it handy as you read through the text as a reference. Using the sheet in this way will provide context.</p>
