		<h3>Melee Attacks</h3>
		<p class="first">Any unit may engage in the Melee with units to their front or side that is within reach of their weapon. For the purposes of Skirmishes, weapons with a Reach of 0 may be used with adjacent units.</p>
		<p>A Melee Attack is resolved by rolling a unit's Fighting Trait versus the Target's Fighting Trait, taking into account any Advantages or Disadvantages. It costs 1 Vitality to attack with one handed weapons and 2 Vitality for a two handed weapon. The amount of damage is determined by the total number of successes resolved from the following formula:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>(Attacker Successes + Weapon) - (Target Successes + Armor) = Damage</p>
		</blockquote>
