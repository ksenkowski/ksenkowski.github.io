		<h2>What is the Tapestry Deck?</h2>	
	</aside>
	<article class="postings first">
		<p>The Tapestry Deck is what we in our false history would consider a Tarot Deck. In our world, the Tarot Deck is a card game that fools in the 1800s began to assign mystical meaning to. Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them they did not realize that the true mirror of the paths of the cosmos is the Tapestry Deck.</p>
		<p>In our true history, many people were conscious of the ever changing ebb and flow of the cosmos and some could gain a clear picture of the river of existence through the Tapestry Deck. According to my translations, the common lore is that the first deck was created in the First Era by XXX as a gift for his mistress, the Oracle of XXX. It was then copied and recopied and spread throughout the world. In my studies I have found evidence of it's use by everyone from the Patriarch of Corriente to the Sorcerer-Kings of the Unknowable East.</p>

		<h2>The Dooms</h2>	
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p><em>The Dooms</em> consist of twenty one cards believed to hold the most power in the deck. Each card represents an allegorical tale that is interpreted based on it's position and placement during a <em>Telling</em>. My studies have led me to believe that these cards represent the primordial powers of both the shadow world we live in and the real world. The fact that they differ so much from what we call Tarot Decks reenforces my belief that the conspiracy fears their usage.</p>

		<h2>The Suit of Flames</h2>	
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p>The <em>Suit of Flames</em> consists of 12 cards highlighting both religious zeal and the culture of the Kalifate, which in my readings seem to be intrinsically tied together. Each card highlights a particular rank within the Kalifate's religo-political hierarchy in some relevant scene. Unlike the lesser suits in a Tarot Deck, the lesser suits in a <em>Tapestry Deck</em> does not burden itself with tying the allegory to each card's number.</p>

			<p>The <em>Suit of Swords</em> consists of 12 cards highlighting both militarism and the culture of the Valadarin people. Each card highlights a particular rank within what I find to be the most common military hierarchy of the countries found between the river Ven and the Sea of Grass. Like the other lesser suits of the <em>Tapestry Deck</em> the <em>Suit of Swords</em> does not burden itself with tying the allegory to each card's number.</p>

		<p>The <em>Suit of Coins</em> consists of 12 cards highlighting both daily life and the culture of the Vorish people. Each card highlights a particular place in the social hierarchy of the Empire, which has held true as far as I can tell for the entire Third Era. Like the other lesser suits of the <em>Tapestry Deck</em> the <em>Suit of Coins</em> does not burden itself with tying the allegory to each card's number.</p>

	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p>The <em>Suit of Stars</em> consists of 12 cards highlighting both mysticism and the Norderin culture. Each card highlights a particular type of practitioner of what we would call sorcery, which unlike the false history we live with, was an actual capability of those who were willing to sacrifice enough to learn it. Like the other lesser suits of the <em>Tapestry Deck</em> the <em>Suit of Stars</em> does not burden itself with tying the allegory to each card's number.</p>
