Avalarik was the only son of Thedomir the Great's daughter Amal and Uvarik, a prince from the Vestarathi Kurdom of Tovosa, succeeding his grandfather at the age of ten years old in 209 3E. His mother assumed his regency and imported tutors from the Empire to raise her son in the Vorian fashion. This angered the Ostarathi nobility who found the Vorians effeminate. The Kurdom found itself split into factions who sought to seize control of the young prince.

When Avalarik reached his majority the state of cold war intrigue erupted in violence when his mother refused to relinquish the regency. The country split in two, with the Ostarathi nobility supporting Avalarik and the Vorish natives supporting the regency. This state of affairs lasted until Avalarik was killed by a poisoned arrow on a hunting trip in 217 3E.
