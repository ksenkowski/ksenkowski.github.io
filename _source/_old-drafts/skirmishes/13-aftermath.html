		<h3>Aftermath</h3>
		<p class="first">Every character that has engaged in a Skirmish loses Vitality equal to the number of Rounds the Skirmish took divided by half. This is in addition to any lost during the Skirmish.</p>
		<p>For each character that has suffered damage you must toss a number of rune stones equal to the number of wounds the character suffered in the Skirmish. That number is subtracted from 24 and compared against the Aftermath Table. </p>
