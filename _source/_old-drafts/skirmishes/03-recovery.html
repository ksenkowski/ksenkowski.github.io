		<h3>Recovery</h3>
		<p class="first">The first round of a Skirmish does not have a Recovery Phase. All other rounds start with the recovery Phase. The Recovery Phase is broken into two segments.</p>
		<p><strong>Vitality Recovery</strong> - Units recover Vitality equal to their Vitality Recovery.</p>
		<p><strong>Morale Challenge</strong> - Each Broken unit gets the chance to make a Leadership Challenge roll to try and return to the fight. Roll the unit's Temperament against a Difficulty equal 7 minus the your commander's Leadership Trait. If a unit is within 2 squares/inches of their Commander, they gain a +1R Advantage to their roll.</p>
