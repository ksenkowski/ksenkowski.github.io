		<h3>What Kind of Game is This?</h3>
		<p class="first"><em>The Mountain</em> is somewhat unique as it is a marriage between the structures and practices of board games and role-playing games. It has a victory condition, utilizes a turn structure for organizing play, and leverages miniatures and maps to resolve battles. It also relies heavily on atmospheric rich narration, character immersion, and player driven action to propel the game forward.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, it is a game designed to be flexible for how you manage your time. Games centered on quests imply long-term time commitments. In this case, I attempted to create a structure and format that let's you pick it up and put it down easily.</p>
