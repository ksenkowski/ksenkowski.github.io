		<h3>Adversaries</h3>
		<p class="first">The road to the Mountain is populated with all manner of monsters and people who would stand in the Cell's way. Creating Adversaries is done utilizing a procedure similar to that used to create characters. This allows you to quickly generate foes to fit into the world of the Mountain.</p>

		<h4>The Destroyer </h4>
		<p class="first">The Destroyer is the embodiment of the wrath of the Conspiracy. Everything they touch collapses under the weight of their wrath, and no two Destroyers are the same. Some are personifications of power, shattering obstacles in their path with brute force. Others are like wisps that float through the world, spreading rot and ruin.</p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>The Destroyer may spend Doom Dice equal to an object's Influence Value to destroy it.</li>
			<li>After murdering someone, spend a Doom Die to transfer their victim's current Willpower into the Destroyer's Vitality Pool.</li>
			<li>When someone gains Wound from a Skirmish with the Destroyer, roll twice on the post Skirmish Condition chart and let the Destroyer pick which result applies.</li>

		<h4>The Pawn </h4>
		<p class="first">There are many Pawns of the Conspiracy. Some know who they are being manipulated by, but most do not, thinking they are pushing their own agenda. Anyone can be a pawn and almost anyone can be turned into one in the right situation.</p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>The Pawn can spend one Doom Die to call 1D6 allies into a Scene they are a part of.</li>
			<li>The Pawn can spend 1 Doom Die to reveal one fact about the Conspiracy and steal a Doom Die from each Cell member in the Scene.</li>
			<li>The Pawn can spend 1 Doom Die to acquire any piece of gear for any member of the Conspiracy.</li>

		<h4>The Purifier </h4>
		<p class="first">The Purifier is the moral compass of the Conspiracy, driven by the need to scour the world clean of the impure. While they would use a knife to excise the cancer that infests the world, they also will not hesitate to unleash the Destroyer. They will do whatever it takes to make the world pure.</p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>When the Purifier murders someone, they may choose to bind that character's soul as if they were subject to the Geas Ritual.</li>
			<li>When the Destroyer inflicts a Wound, the Purifier gains a Doom die.</li>
			<li>The Purifier may remove a Taint Effect from another character and and add 2 to their Willpower Pool.</li>
			<li>If there is no Destroyer in play, the Purifier may upgrade one Pawn into a Destroyer.</li>

		<h4>The Savior </h4>
		<p class="first">The Savior is the prophesied one sent by the evil that resides on the Mountain to guide the masses to enlightenment. They are the one the masses will turn to for leadership, enlightenment, and guidance. It does not matter that all they want is to see the world burn.</p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>The Savior does not suffer any penalties to die rolls brought on by physical Wounds.</li>
			<li>Once per Arc the Savior may remove all Wounds from any one character in the game.</li>
			<li>Once per Arc the Savior may resurrect any dead character. That character automatically becomes a Pawn.</li>
			<li>When facing a crowd, the Savior may give a speech to incite the crowd to taking a specific action (e.g. burn down the quarter, hunt for a person). The Savior makes a Temperament Challenge against a Difficulty of 4 unless a Cell member is working against them. In this case it is an opposed Temperament roll.</li>

		<h4>The Sovereign </h4>
		<p class="first">The Sovereign is the invisible hand that guides the Conspiracy. They  know the true purpose of the evil that lives on the Mountain. They are the one whom manipulate the world like a chess master, moving pieces as they see fit towards an enigmatic goal only they are aware of.</p>
		<ol class="spaced-list">
			<li>The Sovereign does not have to be in a Scene to use one of their abilities to impact that scene. They can instead work through an NPC whom during the duration of their possession shows some sign of the Sovereign's power (e.g. glowing eyes, speaking in a different voice).</li>
			<li>The Sovereign can attempt to turn a character to work for the Conspiracy as a Pawn by simply speaking with them. The Sovereign makes an opposed Temperament Challenge role against the target, with each of the target's Taint Effects granting the Sovereign a +1R.</li>
			<li>The Sovereign may murder a Pawn to gain Doom Dice equal to the Temperament of the Pawn</li>
			<li>Once per Turn the Game Master may ask a player a yes/no question about their character which they must answer truthfully.</li>
			<li>Has a +1R to cast any Wyrding.</li>

		<h4>Create a Mark and an Instinct</h4>
		<p class="first">An Adversary's Mark is a characteristic that makes them stand out and be memorable. They help you get a grasp on the character through auditory, manual or visual descriptions. </p>
		<p>Instincts are the reasoning and motivations of the Adversary. They give you an easy short-hand for how they should behave in a scene. Will they run away from an overwhelming force or stand and fight? To they use sex as a weapon? Are they simply misunderstood or are they malicious in their intent?</p>
		<p>You can create your own Marks and Instincts or use the one provided with the Template.</p>

To make your Adversaries unique look at other Templates or all the Talents available and pick some or swap them out with those found in the Template. Select or create an Artifact and give it to the Adversary. Variety is the spice of life and the spice must flow.</p>
