		<h3>Advancement</h3>
		<p class="first">Every time a character engages in a Challenge add the Difficulty to your Advancement Total. At the end of any Scene where a Skirmish or Challenge occured, toss 24 rune stones and add the Advancement Total. If you toss 666 or greater, the character advances, and you reset your Advancement Total to zero. If you don't reach 666 increase your Advancement Total by a number equal to the number of successes you just tossed. You may then select any Talent so long as your character meets it's requirements.</p>
