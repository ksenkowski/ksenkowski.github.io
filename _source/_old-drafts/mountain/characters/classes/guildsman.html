		<h4>Guildsman</h4>
		<p class="first">In the Great City of Cidiero there are three kinds of criminals, those who are members of the Guild, those who pay a tithe to the Guild and the dead. Over time, the Guild has come to take control of or ally with nearly every criminal organization in the world.</p>
		<p>Among the general populous, the formation of the Guild is laid at the feet of Xenivos Kratides, the Chamberlain of the Palace during the reign of Julio I. At that time crime was so out of control in the wake of the Gray Plague that it threatened the future of the Empire. It is said he took it upon himself to consolidate all the various factions under one central control and that even his execution behind the closed doors of the palace for sedition was a part of this plan. It is whispered that it allowed him to maintain the reigns of power for the Emperador.</p>
		<h5>Talents</h5>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li>Burglar<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>In many ways, burglary is the calling card of the typical Guildsman. It requires expertise at breaking and entering, identifying the location of the desired loot, and escaping with it unnoticed. Add +1R to pick locks, idenitfy security countermeasures, and slipping in and out of a location unnoticed.</small></li>
		<li>Second Story Man<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Burglar<br/>There is an entirely different city with different roads and waypoints up on the rootops, walls, and aqueducts. Second Story Men live in this world, moving between it and the ground seemlessly. You may spend 2 Vitality to move from one neighborhood to another unhindered in any city you find yourself in.</small></li>
		<li>Roller<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>Not all Guildwork requires a subtle hand. Sometimes it requires a hammer, or at the very least a sharply twisted arm. Add +1R to using the threat of violence to resolve a Challenge.</small></li>
		<li>On It!<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>Being a solid Guildsman isn't always about your skills or connections, but about being willing to do anything to get the job done. This approach has it's own rewards outside simply getting the job done. Once per Arc the character may refresh all of their Pools to their maximum in exchange for taking on a job for the Guild. This job is dictated by the GM and occurs as an extra Scene.</small></li>
		<li>Baron of the Marches<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>It takes a special kind of crazy to work a long con, and the Guild only employs the craziest. The character may spend 2 Influence to have any appropriate disguise they need. +1R to deceive in any Challenge.</small></li>
		<li>Dirty Deeds<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Roller<br/>The Guild is not a charity organization, and while it prefers the threat of violence to actual violence, sometimes you have to make good on your threats. That requires special people with very particular talents. Add +1R to any Challenge tied to an assassination.</small></li>
		<li>Duelist<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>There is a special kind of Guildsman who is more rogue than professional thief. They are in it for the adventure the life offers. Most are bored wealthy sons of nobles or artisans, bringing a very special set of skills to the Guild. In every other attack roll during a Skirmish, the character may reroll their attack. They must take the second result.</small></li>
		<li>Card Sharp<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>Playing cards for a living requires a specific set of skills, the most important of which is not cheating. A true card sharp can read the intentions of another person before they even open their mouth to speek. The character may ask the GM what someone they are facing is intending to do, initiating a Challenge in which they get +1R.</small></li>
		<li>Back Alley Brawler<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>The life of a Guildsman is not an easy one. The taverns, alleys, sewers, rooftops, and gambling pits are dangerous places requiring dangerous skills. When fighting in any one of these locations you begin with Tempo regardless of the situation.</small></li>
		<li>Safehouse<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> None<br/>Sometimes when the heat comes down, your usual bolt holes don't want anything to do with you. That is why having a safe place to ride out the storm is so important. Once per Arc the character may spend 5 Influence to have a safehouse at a location that is stocked with needed gear.</small></li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Cultural Synergies</h5>
		<p class="first"></p>
		<ul class="spaced-list unstyled">
		<li>Smuggler's Road<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Rankian Culture<br/>The Rankian criminal families that are affiliated with the Guild have long made their mark smuggling illicite goods into and out of cities all over the world. If there is a Rankian community in a city, the character can purchase any type of good they want, no matter the rarity. They may also spend 1 Influence per individual they wish to sneak into or out of the city.</small></li>
		<li>Old Family<br/><small><strong>Requirements:</strong> Vorish Culture<br/>When the Guild was first formed, it was done by uniting the nine most powerful gangs in Cidiero under a singular ruler elected from their number. These family's still hold the most power in the Guild. When encountering another Guild member, that Guild member is predesposed to work with the character. Any reasonable task can be asked and will be done, for the right price. That individual may also be placed in the character's Network.</small></li>
		</ul>
