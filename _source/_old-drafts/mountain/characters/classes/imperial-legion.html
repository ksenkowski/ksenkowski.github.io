		<h4>Imperial Guardsman</h4>
		<p class="first">The Imperial Guard was originally formed as nine Omada (500 men), with three kept on duty in the capital while the six others served the Emperador's will at various hot spots around the Empire. During these early days of the Empire they remained a tool of the Emperadors with little political ambition. This however changed during the reign of Tiberio. They remained loyal and established themselves as a semi-independent political force.</p>
		<p>During the civil war at the end of the Second Era, the Guard sided against Cid and was destroyed at the battle of Muerlenta Bridge. They remained disbanded until Vasilikos II hired a small army of Navari mercenaries from his brother-in-law Vladimir of Bravich to defend his throne. He divided the survivors into nine Omada as had existed at the dawn of the Empire, dividing their duties between military service and working as the Emperador's personal intelligence service.</p>
