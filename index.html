	<p>The world we live in... It is a lie forced upon us by those shadowy powers that forced the <em>Event</em> upon us. Before that insubstantial point in history the world was a very different place, that was slowly, but surely moving to a place of enlightenment. After they had their way, that all came to a violent end, and now. Now they work hard to make sure you believe what they want you to believe, about people and history.</p>
	<p>This site and the works found within are an attempt to recreate from the shadows and echoes of the world that was. It is my attempt to reveal to the world the magic of our true past and thereby unravel the conspiracy that has ensnared us all.</p>
	<p>Currently I am working on recreating from illuminations a true Tarot Deck, which in the real world translates into a <em>Tapestry Deck</em>. The decks people think of as real and full of power are simply echoes... shadows of an item that carried true power and prophecy. You can see my progress (click the menu) as I recreate this ancient artifact of wonder.</p>
	<!-- p>The <em>Etymologiae</em> is an encyclopedia compiled by Isidro de Mercer in the 319th year of the Third Era. It forms a bridge between a condensed epitome of classical learning of the latter part of the Second Age, and the slowly growing knowledge of the early years of the First Age. According to the accompanying letters to the original text I discovered, the work was composed at the urging of his friend Bonifacio de Retarz, the Osbipo of Solear. You can explore what I have translated from the original text in the menu on the right.</p>
	<p>Along with the translation of the <em>Etymologiae</em>, I am currently working on recreating a true Tarot Deck. The decks people think are real are just echos of the world that truly was before the <em>Event</em>.
