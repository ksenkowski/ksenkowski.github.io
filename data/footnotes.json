I am usually the first one to rail against fantasy settings and how boring they are and so on. I personally hate explicit world building in my fiction and games.</p><p>The truth is, I feel like my work is less world building and more world exploring. I am interested in exploring ideas and events within a specific context, and my own passionate love for actual world history ends up being a creative constraint that hinders that for me personally.</p>"
