<p class="first"><em>Conspiracy of Shadows: Apprentice</em> is a stand alone RPG that is centered around the conflict between the Master and his Apprentice. Strongly influenced by Norse mythology, the game pits these two forces against each other, driving towards a final confrontation. The system is designed to build a narrative over time and leverages Futhark Rune stones to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>The games create complex results from some very simple mechanics. Each player gets a turn to drive the story pushing towards a conclusion, and in the process a story formed and a physical artifact of play is created.</p>
