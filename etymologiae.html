		<p>The Tapestry Deck is what we in our false history would consider a Tarot Deck. In our world, the Tarot Deck is a card game that fools in the 1800s began to assign mystical meaning to. Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them they did not realize that the true mirror of the paths of the cosmos is the Tapestry Deck.</p>
		<p>In our true history, many people were conscious of the ever changing ebb and flow of the cosmos and some could gain a clear picture of the river of existence through the Tapestry Deck. According to my translations, the common lore is that the first deck was created in the First Era by XXX as a gift for his mistress, the Oracle of XXX. It was then copied and recopied and spread throughout the world. In my studies I have found evidence of it's use by everyone from the Patriarch of Corriente to the Sorcerer-Kings of the Unknowable East.</p>
