		<p>One of my clearest memories as a child is of playing in my parents backyard by myself, inventing worlds and stories with <em>G.I.Joe's</em>. I can practically smell the grass I used to make huts and picture in my head the dialogue I invented as I formed fluid narratives that continued form day to day. That urge to create and tell stories has been a driving force in all that I do, be it artistically or for my work.</p>
		<p>This website reflects some of the storytelling I have done over the years. Art, articles, games, and even the code of the site make up a series of narratives. The site is essentially a series of experiments in design, writing, and art all filtered through my personal lens.</p>
