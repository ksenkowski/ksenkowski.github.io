		<h1>making magic happen</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Keith Senkowski and I am an illustrator, author, technologist and game designer. Conspiracy of Shadows is the playground where I share my work and thoughts on things that are important to me.</p>
		<p>I spend most of my days thinking and working in the mobile-first responsive web design space. Being a technologist with a design background has made that front of mind and I am excited to see more and more designers in the digital space embracing the fluidity of the medium.</p>
