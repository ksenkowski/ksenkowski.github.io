What It Is
--------------
This is the Jekyll site for my never ending art project, Conspiracy of Shadows. It is deployed via [GitHub User Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages).

Prerequisites
-------------
The way I run this project requires me to install (if not already on the machine): 
* Ruby 2.2.0-p0
* rbenv
* gulp
* node
* Jekyll
* Travis CLI

Running
-------
Rather than using Jekyll to do the building on it's own, I'm using Gulp to manage the building on the "redesign" branch and leveraging Travis to move the files from the site folder into the Master branch where the site lives on Github Pages. 

You can learn more about this whole process the same place I did, [Savas Labs](http://savaslabs.com/2016/10/25/deploy-jekyll-with-travis.html)
