							<h1>all sin has it's seeds sown in ambition</h1>
							<p class="subtitle">Twelve years ago I published my first table top role-playing game, <strong><em>Conspiracy of Shadows</em></strong>. I had been working on it for years prior and it has morphed and changed over time with a second release, a companion book, and then in 2012 I ran a Kickstarter for <strong><em>Conspiracy of Shadows: Apprentice</em></strong>.</p>
							<p>Since that time I have been tinkering with a new version of the game, taking what I learned from the writing of a non-standard role-playing game and mixing it with my love for traditional games. In 2016 I will be creating hand-made boxed sets for the game as a part of my Patreon, but in the mean time you can find a preview of the rules here.</p>
