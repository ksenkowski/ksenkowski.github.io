		<h2 class="first">Conspiracy of Shadows Simple RPG</h2>			
	</aside>
	<article class="postings first">
		<p>I used to design and publish role-playing games. For about ten years I have experimented and designed dozens of games, fragments of games, and a few fully realized, published games, and throughout that entire time I was never truly happy. Since I stopped working on games for publication I find myself much happier focusing my creative energies elsewhere.</p>
		<p>The fact that I stopped designing games for publication doesn't mean that I have stopped designing and playing games. The following outline encompasses the basic rules that I am using with my friend Nathan to play a Conspiracy of Shadows game. It is an amalgam of game ideas, some my own, some from designers I respect and admire.</p>
		<p>The entire goal of this page is to work as a reference for Nathan and I as we stumble through a little game. It is a hack, there are holes, it will change a lot as we play, and some areas are clearly more worked out than others. To play it all you need is a big bunch of six sided dice, several different colored tokens, and the cards linked below.</p>

		<h2>Characters</h2>			
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p>Characters are created through a simple question and answer process. This creates the character's list of Descriptors and Relationships as well as sets the groundwork for the hard stats. It is essentially a conversation between the player and the GM to figure out what exactly the game will be about. Below I have listed the questions as well as a summary of what Nathan answered for his character.</p>
		<h4>Questions and Answers</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>What culture do you want your character to be from?<br/>
				<em>The Malin Culture and I am going to take Storytelling as my Descriptor.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Where were you from? What kind of place was it? What sort of position in society did you come from?</br>
				<em>Falah ibn Hamzah is from a small town on the coast of the Middle Sea. It is a pirate haven in the Kalifate, but his parents were </em>
			</li>
			<li>What did your mother do? What did you learn from her?<br/>
				<em>Her name as Jameela and she was a teacher. I learned from her the History of the Empire.</em>
			</li>
			<li>What did your father do? What did you learn from him?<br/>
				<em>His name was Hamzah. He was well known as a negotiator. A fixer of sorts who used storytelling to get what he wanted. From him I learned Dealmaker.</em>
			</li>
			<li>What did you do at home? What was your first job?<br/>
				<em>I worked the docks as a young man doing odd jobs before I sought a life at sea. From that I learned Handyman.</em>
			</li>
			<li>So you shipped out to sea. What was that like? What did you learn?<br/>
				<em>I started as a sailor on a merchantman plying the Middle Sea. From that life I learned Deckhand.</em>
			</li>
			<li>What happened next? How did you end up in the Company of the Black Stag?<br/>
				<em>Well first I was taken as spoils by pirates. However I used my dealmaker skills to find myself in the position of Quartermaster, which is the skill I picked up.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Is that how you made it into the company? Some connection with the pirates?<br/>
				<em>No. The pirates were destroyed by the Imperial Navy, but I was spared and did a five year tour in the Imperial Army to earn my freedom. From that I picked up Cultural Chameleon.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Ok. Then you joined the Company of the Black Stag?<br/>
				<em>Yes. I mustered out with another Malin named Bakri ibn Butrus and we found a place with the company. I as the Quartermaster, where I picked up Art of Negotiation, and he as a Sergeant.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Well I need to know who the captain of the company is and we need an enemy. Any ideas?<br/>
				<em>The Captain's name is Ortega de Palano. He is a minor noble. Probably a younger son. I am not in his confidence, but we respect each other. My enemy it a young Lieutenant named Alonso de Paz.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Okay. Now we need to sort out your gear. Because you are in an infantry company... Well mobile infantry company, let's say you have a sword, shield and light infantry harness. Now select three things based on your history.<br/>
				<em>I select a Black Pearl from my father (Useful For Making Decisions About the Future), a deck knife (Useful As A Tool) I have kept since I first set to sea, and a compass (Useful For Finding My Way) I took with me when I joined the Imperial Army.</em>
			</li>
			<li>Alright. Last thing. Split among your traits 6/5/4/4/3/3/2/2.<br/>
				<em>Ok. Temperament (3), Commander (4), Performer (5), Sorcerer (2), Criminal (2), Craftsman (3), Warrior (4), and Survivor (6). My computed traits are Vitality (Temperament + Criminal + Warrior + Survivor = 15), Influence (Commander + Performer + Craftsman = 12), and Willpower/Taint (Commander + Sorcerer = 6, 6 - Temperament = 3). My recovery rate for Vitality is 6 (Survivor), Influence is 5 (Performer), and Willpower/Taint is 3 (Temperament).</em>
			</li>

		<h2>Gear</h2>			
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p>For this hack, Gear comes in three different types, Arms, Armor and Everything Else. Arms and Armor have very specific mechanics tied to them for the Duel mechanic. Everything else has Descriptors that start with <em>Useful for...</em> and end with whatever the item is useful for. This item, when used, provides a +1D for the appropriate activity. Below are three tables outlining the Arms, Armor, and a collection of Everything Else.</p>

		<h2>Basic Mechanics</h2>			
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
		<p>The basic mechanic has two parts. One is a resource management mechanic tied to the character's three main resources and the other is the actual dice. When a character falls into opposition with the Game Master, meaning the Game Master has decided to say no to the player's narration of events, the GM first determines what kind of Challenge the character must overcome.</p>
		<p>Challenges fall into six categories. These categories dictate how many successes the player must roll as well as what the cost is to the appropriate resource. Vitality is required to engage in any physical activity, Influence for any social activity, and Willpower can be used for any physical, mental or sorcerous activity. The following chart illustrates the costs and requirements per Challenge.</p>
		<table class="responsive">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Challenge Difficulty</th>
					<th>Successes</th>
					<th>Cost</th>
					<th>Harm Duration</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Tough</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1 Scene</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Challenging</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>2 Scenes</td>

				</tr>

		</table>
		<p>To resolve a Challenge the player rolls a number of six sided dice equal to the skill appropriate to the Challenge plus an additional die for each appropriate Descriptor piece of Gear. </p>
		<p>Should a character fail, the GM has two options they can pursue. They can either deny the character what they want (boring), give the character what they want and assign them Harm or give the character what they want and add a complication to their plan.</p>
		<p>Harm is essentially a condition that applies a -1D to a specific set of circumstances for a specific set of time. The time is dictated as seen in the Challenge chart above and the circumstances are based on the context of the situation as interpreted by the GM.</p>
		<p>Complications are narrative elements that shift the story in another direction as defined by the Game Master. The typical flow of the game is for the player(s) to narrate what they are doing and for the GM to interact. Complications are the opportunity for the Game Master to move the game in a different direction.</p>
	</article>
	<aside>
		<h2>Duels</h2>			
	</aside>
	<article class="postings">
				<p>This is the structure of a Duel. Duels go on until one character is incapacitated or surrenders. Will/Taint can be used to augment their character's Vitality Pool. Any Taint that appears counts only once towards the character's Taint progression and is resolved after the Duel is completed.</p>
				<p>Duels are to incapacitation. A characters is incapacitated if they have lost all of their Vitality Pool immediately after card resolution. At this time, the opponent can choose to dispatch the character or let them live.</p>
				<p>After a Duel the GM determines the physical fallout of the conflict. Use the following chart as a guideline to determine the type of Harm a character suffers.</p>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Wound Type</th>
							<th>Recommended Harm</th>
							<th>Duration</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Superficial</td>
							<td>-1D to Physical Actions</td>
							<td>1 Scene Per Wound</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Deep</td>
							<td>-2D to Physical Actions</td>
							<td>1 Week Per Wound</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Massive</td>
							<td>-1D to Physical Actions</td>
							<td>Permanent</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>The initial state of a Duel is dictated by the narration of the Scene leading up to it. Whichever character is the aggressor (initiating the violence), that character has the Tempo. Having the Tempo dictates what cards you can play.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Place the Tempo card in front of the player whose character has the Tempo.</li>
					<li>Each player takes cards from his Duel Deck into their hand equal to their Warrior Skill. This is their plan of action. At any point a player may spend 1 Vitality or Willpower/Taint Point to swap a card from their hand with a card from their deck.</li>
					<li>Both player simultaneously places a token on his Guard card indicating his starting Guard.</li>
					<li>The player with the Tempo lays their first card(s) and pays the Vitality cost. The Player must declare what part of the body of their opponent they are targeting.</li>
					<li>The defender answers the attack with:
						<ul>
							<li>Playing a Defense card, declaring they are done, and pays the Vitality cost.</li>
							<li>Playing a Defense card, an Attack card and pays the Vitality cost. The Player must declare what part of the body of their opponent they are targeting.</li>
							<li>Playing an Attack card and pays the Vitality cost.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The player with Tempo answers the defender's response with:
						<ul>
							<li>When faced with a Defense card, declares that they are done and resolves the cards.</li>
							<li>When faced with a combo of a Defense and Attack card either:
								<ul>
									<li>Declares that they are done and resolves the cards.</li>
									<li>Plays a Defense card.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The Exchange is now resolved. If at any time during an Exchange on player is successful (such as the initial attack), the follow up cards are ignored and brought back into each player's hand.
						<ol>
							<li>The player with the Tempo card makes their draw as indicated by their card and their weapon.</li>
							<li>The defender makes their draw as indicated by their card and their weapon.
								<ul>
									<li>If the defender wins but did not play an attack card as a follow up, the Tempo stays with the attacker and continue the Exchange.</li>
									<li>If the defender wins and did play an attack card as a follow up, they gain the Tempo card and draw for their attack card. If the initial attacker in the Exchange played a defense card, resolve the cards.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
						To resolve the cards, the player with the most successes wins the resolution. The attacker then compares their net number of successes (the attacker's successes minus the defenders's successes) against their opponent's armor value for that location and subtracts that number from their successes. If there are any successes remaining, they are compared against the Harm chart and the effect is applied.
					</li>
					<li>If all of the characters are still alive, capable, and still have cards in their hand, return to step five. Continue this cycle until either a character is dead, incapacitated, one player has no more cards to play or a player disengages.</li>
					<li>Once a character either disengages or one player runs out of cards from their hand, the Exchange is over. Each character recovers Vitality equal to their recovery rate. If a character disengages while having the Tempo card, they now lose it to their opponent. Otherwise, the character with the Tempo card retains it for the next Exchange, starting at Step 1 above.</li>

				<h2>Measure &amp; The Lines</h2>			
			</aside>
			<article class="postings">
				<p>Measure is the relative distance between two opponents that dictates what cards can be played and what impact they have. The Measure card is placed between the two players with a coin placed upon the starting Measure. As Measure changes through the movement of the characters, move the coin. In the case of multiple opponents, each opponent has it's own Measure card to show their relative positioning.</p>

				<p>Only Guard Change and movement cards can be used Out of Measure. Using Disengage here ends the Duel via flight.</p>

				<p>Only the Passing Attack action can be played from Wide Measure in Tempo. All other attacks grant Tempo to the opponent.</p>

				<p>All actions save Grapple and Toss are possible in Narrow Measure.</p>

				<p>All actions save Girata and Passing Attack are possible in the Clinch.</p>
				<h4>The Lines</h4>
				<p>There are two lines in which you may attack and defend, the Inside and Outside line. Several action cards are marked with either the Inside or Outside line. Specific Guards work better against different lines of attack.</p>
