In Cidiero strange things occur at an alarming rate. Neighborhoods suddenly become overrun with rats only to have them all disappear days later. People will vanish in the night, returning days later with no memory of their former life. When night falls, the land and air seems to warp and bend as if the laws of nature no longer applied.

All of these events and more intrude on the lives of the inhabitants, unnoticed and unrecorded. The sinister forces shape the world, bending and breaking it at will. However, a small number of men and woman have seen through the lies. They have walked in the light, see mankindâ€™s potential, and crippling impact of the **Conspiracy**.

In *Conspiracy of Shadows*, you play a character driven by the knowledge of the hidden malevolence of the **Conspiracy** and risk your life searching for a means to thwart it. A game of paranoia, horror, and tragedy, *Conspiracy of Shadows* draw on themes from gothic and pulp horror fiction, conspiracy fiction, and the kinetic action found in modern horror-action films against the backdrop of a twisted reflection of medieval Europe.

*Conspiracy of Shadows* is a role-playing game that places characters in an underground Cell working  against the machinations of the **Conspiracy**. In this game you will balance your identity with a secret identity, hunt supernatural horrors and mortal conspirators. All you need is a willingness to see how far you are willing to go to learn the truth.
