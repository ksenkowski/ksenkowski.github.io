title:  "The Dooms"
description: "The Dooms are the Major Arcana of the Tapestry Deck. Like the Tarot deck, they are designed with allegorical and exoteric meaning in mind."

		<h2>What are the Dooms?</h2>	
	</aside>
	<article class="postings first">
		<p>The Dooms consist of twenty one cards believed to hold the most power in the deck. Each card represents an allegorical tale that is interpreted based on it's position and placement during a <em>Telling</em>. My studies have led me to believe that these cards represent the primordial powers of both the shadow world we live in and the real world. The fact that they differ so much from what we call Tarot Decks reenforces my belief that the conspiracy fears their usage.</p>
		<p>Each of the the following translations are excerpts from <em>The Threads of the Tapestry</em> I have been able to decipher so far. They are by no means the entire allegory associated with each card. My hope is that one day I will find a complete copy or at the very least discover replacements for the pages that I have which are damaged.</p>

		<h3>The Dark Master</h3>
	
		<p class="call-out">The hour was late, yet still he sat, impassive, cold eyes watching as each victim of his wrath was brought before him and beheaded. Seven hundred men of authority and power, paraded before him, naked and sweating in terror despite the icy wind coming off the harbor. Doomed men each, crying, begging, staring with imperious disdain at the architect of their destruction, each met his end before a man who gave ants more consideration.</p>

		<h3>The Shepherd</h3>
	
		<p class="call-out">And so I asked him which path must I take and his face lit up with smile that revealed pearly teeth that sharply contrasted with his brown, sun-worn skin. His eyes, a muddy brown before I spoke, seemed to swirl with a hundred different shades of brown. With the deep voice of an old man rather than the young boy before me he said, <em>Are not all paths the same, leading to all places?</em></p>

		<h3>The Charlatan</h3>
	
		<p class="call-out">He turned to me, a wicked smile on his face, and a soft chuckle escaping between sentences as he said, <em>You want to know the truth? The terrifying, honest truth? I take sheer delight in bringing destruction to the world. Pitting man against man.</em></p>
		<p class="call-out">Such words. Such power. And yet he stood before me in moth eaten clothes that had seen better days. Chalk dust lay like a dew over every inch of him, and the skull he played with looked older than a hundred generations of men, not the skull of his greatest enemy.</p>

		<h3>The Puppet</h3>
	
		<p class="call-out">He was shook uncontrollably despite the oppressive jungle heat, taking deep pulls from his pipe between each stuttered sentence. <em>That is what... what. They start when you are young, you understand. When you don't know any better. They freeze you in time, then shatter you with a hammer. If you are lucky you go mad. If not, they stitch the parts back together with hot irons and that same damn hammer.</em></p>
