		<p>While I found a lot of this issue's content to be lacking, it did trigger a lot of thoughts. That is sometimes the case with these things and why I love <strong>Dragon</strong> so much. It wasn't always the content itself or the art, but where my brain went in reaction to it. In some ways <strong>Dragon</strong> is at it's best when it is prompting you to write the issue you wanted to see, not the one they presented you.</p>

			<p>A funny thing happens when I see the great <strong>Phil Foglio's</strong> artwork. It is always recognizable, which brings a smile to my face. This is always followed by an internal debate in my head because in my brain I mispronounce his name as <em>Foliogo</em>. I have no idea what my problem is.</p>
			<p>Anyway, this cover is pleasantly amusing. It isn't by any streach of the imagination his best work, but it does it's job well. Considering how much of a pain in the ass taxes are for the average freelancer, I am doubly amused by the idea of adventurers getting hit by the tax man.</p>

			<p>This article on finding the right DM to play with is pretty interesting. Not so much because of the content but because of how I met some of my closest friends through a <a href="http://burningwheel.com" target="_blank">Burning Wheel</a> game. It basically was a nerd interview.</p>
			<p>How it went down, I was pointed in their direction and we met a Cleo's on Chicago Ave. I walked in, found three guys sitting at a table and introduced myself. What followed was something similar to the <em>chemistry test</em> we use when hiring folks at my work. You get a feel for interests, attitudes and personality quirks. All and all, I think a very effective way to find folks you want to spend time playing games with.</p>

			<p>I just thought this public announcement was interesting because of the ongoing debate when I got into game design way back in 2004. Back then the question was, <em>Is it worth joining GAMA as an independent game designer?</em> Ultimately I along with many of my peers of that day thought no because the cost/benefit of the time. However, back in the day it had to make sense.</p>

			<p>Years ago I used to run <strong>AD&amp;D Second Edition</strong> all the time for basically anyone who was interested. I had a core group of friends that always played, but we always had folks filter in and out. Because of that and my desire to play with the new toys in <strong>Dragon</strong> and stuff I picked up at the local <strong>Waldenbooks</strong> we cycled through <em>campaigns</em> pretty quickly.</p>
			<p>Despite that cycle of play, because we had the core four players, it almost became really one game. Like the <strong>Eternal Champion</strong>, names changed but fundamental characters stayed the same. Two of those players were basically <strong>Abbot and Costello</strong>, always at odds and getting into trouble because of the constant back and forth.</p>
			<p>From that interplay I learned the importance of a good donkey or mule, particularly one called <strong>Alexi</strong>. See,  <strong>Costello</strong> named his donkey after <strong>Abbott's</strong> character leading to many amusing moments of play. <strong>Abbott</strong> really wanted to kill his namesake, but because the donkey carried so much gear he never could bring himself to do it.</p>

			<p>Underwater rules for RPGs always seem to suck. They either go deep down the rabbit hole of <em>realism</em> or are entirely unsatisfying in their <em>hand-wavery</em>. This set of rules is a bit more of the former than the latter, but I thought the general approach (outlined in the first paragraph) was a good faith attempt to get it right.</p>
			<p>What really caught my eye was the second section. The question it poses is valid and rife with interesting game play options. A few issues ago we got the <strong>Temple of Poseidon </strong> as an insert. It is a shame this wasn't in that issue along with a <em>wilderness</em> setting surrounding it all with this kind of content exploration.</p>

			<p>There is this weird 48<sup>1/2</sup> issue inside of issue 48, but it isn't very well deliniated. I think it is meant to be a humor bit, but the humor is so awful I'm not sure where one ends and the other begins.</p>
			<p>Despite that, what is truly criminal is that I can't find who did the art for this cover. The style is really familiar and it is killing me that I can't figure it out. It is a wonderful little piece and the artist deserves the recognition.</p>
