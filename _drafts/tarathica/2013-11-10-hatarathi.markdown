<p class="first">The Hatarathi were a Tarathi people from the high plains in the *Unknowable East*. They are first mentioned in the works of Zellas as confederates of the Karatarathi, who at the <span class="footnote" title="The Epistles to Zeno, 1344 2E" rel="tooltip">time of his writing</span>, they had taken the Hegoi Wall had overrun <span class="footnote" title="Kurdom of Zerem" rel="tooltip">Ilaria</span>, <span class="footnote" title="Zwardom of Karatan" rel="tooltip">Sloria</span>, and were threatening Greater Voria. This incursion came to a close when they were routed at the *Battle of Nis* by the Emperodar Claudio Tarathodar. The Hatarathi were driven back over the Hegoi Wall into <span class="footnote" title="Eastern Toloska" rel="tooltip">Kidava</span>, which Amon eventually pulled the Empire out of in a bid to create a more manageable frontier.</p>

In 50, the Dux Primero of the East, Vincente I, attacked the Hatarathi north of the Kid River, sparking the first Tarathi War (50-52 3E). For two years he chased the Hatarathi and the Karatarathi through the Kidava basin, unable to engage them as they melted away each time he brought his forces to bear. It wasn't until he was able to pin a large force against the Zeged Mountains in the north and force a damaging peace in which hostages and jade were taken, which was to be followed by an annual tribute of jade and amber in vast quantities.

This remained the status quo until 59 3E, when the Hatarathi Kur Fritivar appealed to Vincent I to allow his people to seek refuge within the Empire from the ravages of the Cavasla. Seeking to create a buffer between the Empire and this new, seemingly unstoppable threat, refused. Desperate from fear and a famine that swept the region that year, the Hatarathi and Karatarathi invaded (Second Tarathi War 59-65 3E), with the Hatarathi moving south into Palidia. There they met with imperial forces at the Battle of Palido, where they crushed the imperial army and slew Vincente I, sending the Empire into turmoil.

The end result of this war was a negotiated peace in which the Tarathi remained within the borders of the Empire as a client petty Kurdom. Shortly thereafter the Vestarathi migrated into the Empire and assimilated the Hatarathi. The Vestarathi Kur Avukar I married the only child of Fritivar and united the two people forever more.
